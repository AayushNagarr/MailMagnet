Join Medium. Hi everyone, As I enjoy the last dregs of summer in Chicago, I bask in the nearly-perfect pre-winter weather, the joy in returning my kids to school, and the mouth-watering vegetables that are finally ready to pluck from the garden. To me, being in this space is a manifestation of happiness. Then I read Charles Black’s piece that offers a distinct way to consider happiness: wanting what you already have instead of wishing for something else. It made me think about how the decision to alter your attitude could possibly shift the energy you bring to any event, or to yourself. “We can all be happy now if we learn to want what we have rather than trying to have what we want,” writes Black in the Better Humans publication. This is probably true for lots of situations and not true for others. Paolo Pontoniere similarly takes a practical approach, describing “striving for nirvana” as a paradox unto itself. And, the publication Wise & Well tackled the definition of happiness in this way: “The very ingredients of happiness — or what scientists like to call life satisfaction or subjective well-being — actually change over time.” It seems that folks in the 1930s defined happiness as having “security, knowledge and religion.” Today? Who knows. What’s clear here is that happiness is different for everyone. I’m curious what you think about such joy or how to quantify and define it. What is happiness to you? What makes you happy? If you write on this topic, please let me know by tagging me in the story or replying to this email! (And yes, I really do read your stories.) See you on Medium.

Lien Word of the Day The legal claim on an asset in the settlement of a debt is known as a lien. Consider taking a loan from a friend. To make sure you repay them, they can request something (like gold, real estate, etc) that is valuable to you. This item is called a collateral. Lien is the power to claim this collateral in case the loan is not repaid on time. 6 Day Course Theme: mutual fund companies Day 5: Friday Many mutual fund companies were started by existing banks. Example: HDFC, SBI, ICICI, etc. One important detail investors must know is that these are separate companies. They are not operated as the same company. Many times, these are jointly run with another asset management company. Example: ICICI Prudential — here ‘Prudential’ is the partner company and the mutual fund company is called ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund Note: there are mutual fund companies started by non-bank companies. Example: Tata Asset Management, Motilal Oswal Asset Management, etc. Missed last week\\'s course? You can downloa d the course PDF - click to download . Featured Question “What are the open ended and fixed ended funds? When we invest an SIP is it mandatory to decide for how many years that we need to invest? Or we can invest for the period based on the need and can be withdrawn?” Open-ended mutual funds do no have any lock-in period. Most investors stick to open-ended mutual funds. Close-ended mutual funds have a lock-in period. SIPs are not allowed in close-ended mutual funds. In case of SIPs in open-ended mutual funds, you need not decide the time period. Once you invest via SIP, the amount will remain invested — until you withdraw it. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

I recently caught up with a friend who’d founded a company. He was at a low point: overwhelmed, sleep deprived, stressed… I listened, nodded, and said, “I remember those days.” And I do remember them. It took years before my startup Anchor began to gain real traction. There were sleepless nights and drastic pivots, crashed servers and bad bugs. Most founders I speak to agree that the startup journey is generally discouraging, overrun with unsolvable challenges and many many mistakes. “But there’s good stuff too, right?” my friend asked. I assured him there was. I said that the high points, while few and far between, would be worth it. I added that the low points, while no fun in the moment, are all things that make you smarter down the road. I explained that most of his energy and concern was probably expended on things that wouldn’t matter in the long run. I told him that when I was on the journey, I too had these periods of doubt. He asked, “What would you have done differently?” And rather than giving him just my answer — which might have been unique to my experience, not applicable to his — I decided to do something different and write this article. I posed a question to twenty-one other founders, across many different industries from media to finance, from SaaS to urban farming. The question I asked them was this: If you could go back in time and give your younger self some advice just as you were starting your founder journey, what would you say? Their answers are below. And I sincerely want to thank all of them for contributing and providing their perspectives. - Harish Agarwal, Chartable — Make sure you’re clear eyed about who your customer is and that helping solve their problems is a durable source of motivation. - Amy Bach, Measures for Justice — You will make mistakes. Don’t beat yourself up about them. Instead, remember them to increase your gratitude for your team.

Venturing out onto the high, big deck to watch the sun rise over the ocean was an early-morning treat. Seagulls would circle above us looking for handouts and we would oblige with pieces of bread. One of the gulls had an injured leg. The poor thing would land on the railing looking for food, teetering on his one good leg. We would make sure this gull got his fill as we felt sorry for him. We called him Peg Leg. One of the other gulls observed the favoritism Peg Leg was getting. Eventually he pretended to the same malady by landing on the railing and tucking one of his good legs up into his body, feigning a limp. Egrote in birds? It was amazing to witness. Alice Davis, Blacksburg, Virginia ---------------------------- From: Miriam Schwartz (pieface880 gmail.com) Subject: egrote In medical school, my friend would occasionally call in \"\"sick, not sick\"\". Her go-to illness was always vomiting and diarrhea. She reasoned that no one would take a chance of getting that kind of sick, whereas a mere cold was considered something one should just \"\"man up\"\" and work through. She egroted like a champ. Miriam Schwartz, Bellingham, Washington ---------------------------- From: Craig Matthiessen (racinut6 gmail.com) Subject: egrote My favorite feigned illness excuse is: \"\"I need a day off due to vision problems. I just can\\'t see coming to work today.\"\" R.C. Matthiessen, Burke, Virginia ---------------------------- From: Jenny Daniel (jennygu1nver gmail.com) Subject: egrote In English universities, a person who was not able to take their final (or other) exams because of illness would be given an aegrotat https://wordsmith.org/words/aegrotat.html . Jenny Daniel, UK ---------------------------- From: Anu Garg (words wordsmith.org) Subject: Words with AI usage examples This week we featured some rare words for which it was hard to find a good usage example. So we recruited AI to see what it would come up with. The examples were generated in the style of various well-known authors. Everything was clearly explained. Everything was clearly marked. Yet the made-up usage examples in the style of famous writers displeased some readers. Tobey Hiller http://thiller.ag-sites.net/index.htm of San Rafael, California (tobeyhiller gmail.com) wrote: \"\"I deeply object to your using a fake quote (ChatGPT-generated) from a fake Jane Austen novel. You are, I am sure, deeply familiar with the ways of the online world, and though I see both the humor and the contemporary currency of your intention, surely you now know that soon enough the Jane Austen novel \"\"The Convenient Colds of Highbury\"\" will appear in high school or even college essays all over the country.\"\" Even though it was clearly stated at the top of the page that the examples were made up, we then added a note right next to the quotations as well, stating that they were AI-generated. A reader named Lili (who shall otherwise remain anonymous; you\\'ll see in a second why) canceled her subscription and wrote that using AI to come up with usage examples this week was \"\"akin to digging up corpses to abuse them.\"\" We respectfully disagree with her simile. But we admire her restraint in not going for \"\"Nαzi\"\". We invited readers to come up with their own usage examples of this week\\'s words as if written by prominent authors. Here\\'s a small selection. The secret of egroting can be given in two maxims: stick to the pillow, and whenever you can, snore. (Egrote in the Style of W. Somerset Maugham) -Terry J. Stone, Goldendale, Washington (cgs7952 bellsouth.net) Corsets once caused ladies to egrote Shapewear now causes ladies to bloat Nevertheless It\\'s still distress (Not quite as precise as Ogden Nash, but that\\'s what I was going for...) -Ivy Kaminsky, Pasadena, Texas (ivykaminsky yahoo.com) may I egrote, said he i\"\"ll emote, said she (e.e. cummings) -Penni Fromm, Boca Raton, Florida (pennifromm yahoo.com) \"\"I drew my breath and turned toward the open volume gathering dust and broadcasting rhymes toward a ceiling plastered with bourbon stains and offering no sympathy for a lonely philomuse who thought he was ode a debt of gratitude for not being roped into becoming a poet lariat who thinks nothing rhymes with orange when clearly it does not and I can see that even without spectacles seated on my bridge over troubled waters that run deep which I thought were lost and found under my very nose a gift from God as I would never pick it myself even if I were on strike during a time when the iron is hot or when I encounter someone leading a séance with a joyful smile on her face ...\"\" (My imagined James Joyce quote using \"\"philomuse\"\" written with the hope he wouldn\\'t mind my PUNching it up a bit.) -Ken Kirste, Sunnyvale, California (kkkirste sbcglobal.net) \"\"Are you a quill-driver or a philomuse?\"\" asked Elizabeth. \"\"Or a deliberate delibate? I cannot tell, for your talents seem multivarious, but I have not observed you long enough to discern their depth, or breadth.\"\" \"\"Madam, you can scarcely expect me to proffer you a satisfactory answer,\"\" replied Darcy, \"\"for your aim is surely to compare my talents with those of any accomplished lady.\"\" \"\"As we had been discussing,\"\" interjected Bingley, with a smile that disarmed the combatants. Caroline, certain that Elizabeth\\'s sister was egroting in order to prolong her proximity to Bingley, enjoyed a faint satisfaction at her brother\\'s engagement with the conversation rather than with the invalid. This satisfaction was tempered, however, by her observation of Darcy and Elizabeth, and she soon drew Darcy away on some pretext, in order to re-position herself as the zenzic fourth member of the two unacknowledged couples. (I just happened to be re-reading \"\"Pride and Prejudice\"\" right now; here\\'s my entry with four of this week\\'s words!) -Alexandra Halsey, Seattle, Washington (alexandra.s.halsey gmail.com) ---------------------------- From: Breanne Boland (breanneboland gmail.com) Subject: AI I\\'m a security engineer and have to deal with and advise on a lot of rather silly (or at least superfluous enough to be needlessly risky without sufficient benefit, by my estimate) uses of AI, so I must congratulate you on finding what is, by my estimate, the sixth genuinely appropriate use of this technology I have seen. I\\'m super cynical about this stuff by both disposition and profession, but this made me smile. Well done, and thank you (as ever) for everything you do! Breanne Boland, Seattle, Washington ---------------------------- From: Daniel Miller (milldaniel gmail.com) Subject: Rubiales A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: The heart of a mother is a deep abyss, at the bottom of which you will always find forgiveness. -Honore de Balzac, novelist (1799-1850) For an example of this, look at how Rubiales\\' mother is defending his attack on Jennifer Hermoso. She, the mother, is on a hunger strike inside a church and claims that since no one was killed, it\\'s no big deal, and her son is being unjustly terrorized. Daniel Miller, Laredo, Texas ---------------------------- From: Bob Freeman (hendon zol.co.zw) Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--secundan Refer: https://wordsmith.org/words/secundan.html In \"\"Through the Looking Glass\"\" the White Queen offers Alice employment with the perk \"\"jam every other day\"\". Sadly, that means that there is jam available yesterday and tomorrow, but never today. So, whenever it is today, there is no jam!

Hmm... just happened to be a final math exam scheduled for that day. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53137414672/ Growing up in Canada with deep Scots roots, the phrase \"\"a wee dram\"\" was not foreign to me, often referring to a jigger of single-malt whiskey. I harken back to my summer of 1996 50th-birthday trip to Scotland and my guided tour of the Glenfiddich distillery. At the end of the tour, we were offered a wee dram of their golden elixir. From personal experience, I recommend delibating this potent potable. Yet the macho Scots would insist on downing it in one grand gulp. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53138013226/ Alex McCrae, Van Nuys, California ---------------------------- From: Karen Folsom (kgfols yahoo.com) Subject: Egrote Here\\'s my take, replete with fainting couch. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53148560074/ Karen Folsom, Santa Barbara, California https://kgfolsart.com/ ---------------------------- Anagrams This week\\'s theme: Words with AI usage examples 1.

Rotation of the forearm so that the palm faces downward or backward. 2. Rotation of the foot such that the weight is borne on its inner edge. 3. The resulting position when the arm or foot is rotated in such a manner. [From Latin pronare (to turn or lean forward). Earliest documented use: 1657.

Each of them is licensed to perform a different function. In this week’s course, we’ll explore some of these certifications, their capabilities, and their limitations. Let’s start with Chartered Accountant (CA). Those who are certified CAs are famous for performing audits and filing taxes for their clients. They are also involved in advisory, compliance, consulting, bankruptcy proceedings, and assurance of many finance-related matters. There are a few other tasks also in which they are involved. Sometimes, they advise their clients with regard to investing also — but that is not a part of their CA certification. Missed last week\\'s course?

But tax saving funds are having locking period and hence are closed ended type but allows SIP. Why is it so ?” This can be a bit confusing. Tax saving mutual funds are open-ended mutual funds (technically speaking). They are open-ended mutual funds — that have a lock-in period of 3 years. That is why you are able to do an SIP into them. In close-ended mutual funds, you have to invest by a certain date. And you can take out money from these close-ended mutual funds only on a certain date (after the lock-in ends). In case of tax-saving mutual funds, the money is locked-in for 3 years from the date of investment. After those 3 years, the amount remains invested in the mutual fund. But you can take it out any time you want (just like any other open-ended mutual fund). Note: Tax saving mutual funds and ELSS funds are the same thing. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

This is an educational arm of the SEBI that conducts the NISM exams. NISM certification is not one certification. There are many levels of NISM certifications. NISM certification is useful in many fields. It is most popular for becoming a registered investment advisor (RIA) — to give finance advice to people. To become an RIA, a person would have to clear some levels of NISM certification. It must be added here, NISM certifications can be taken by anybody, not necessarily those who want to become an advisor. Missed last week\\'s course?

To get the PE ratio, you -take the price of the share -divide it by the earnings (per share) What this tells you is how high the price of a stock is when compared to the money it is earning. PE ratio is used by many investors to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued. But there is no \\'right\\' level. It varies from investor to investor. The PE ratio of companies in same industries are usually similar. For example, companies from the infra sector will likely have similar PE ratios. Banking sector companies\\' PE will be similar. And so on. This is where the concept of sector PE ratio comes in. They calculate the PE ratio of an entire industry or sector (infra, pharma, banking, etc). Based on that, they can look at individual stocks and decide if the PE ratio is too high or too low. Example: The sector PE ratio of IT stocks is 25. So, when an investor sees an IT company stock’s PE ratio being 20, he/she might say that the stock is undervalued in comparison to the sector. The sector PE ratio of energy stocks is 15. So, when an investor sees an energy stock’s PE being 20, he/she might say that the stock is overvalued. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

Rally Word of the Day When a lot of money is flowing into the stock markets and is driving stock prices higher, it is known as a stock market rally. A rally may indicate the optimism of investors. A share price rally need not just occur when the markets are in a bullish trend. It can also be seen when the market is going bearish. 6 Day Course Theme: finance certifications Day 3: Wednesday CFA. Chartered Financial Analyst. This is a global-level course. It is quite lengthy and requires a fairly long preparation period. There are 3 levels of the CFA exam. It deals with topics like asset management, portfolio management, valuation, etc. It is not mandatory, but still, many Indian students are opting for this course if they aspire to work in banking, financial sector, investment management, fintech, and consulting. People who attempt the CA and NISM certifications mostly do so to work directly with clients. CFA aspirants mostly attempt the exam to improve their chances of getting high paying job roles.

For example, if I want to know the value of today\\'s 10 Crores after 30 years, how should I calculate?” Over time, the buying power of money reduces. This is what depreciation means. Example: 10 years ago: 1 litre milk = Rs 40 per litre Today: 1 litre milk = Rs 50 per litre So here, the buying power of Rupee has reduced. This means, things getting expensive cause the depreciation of the Rupee. Or, in other words, inflation causes depreciation. So, for example, if the rate of inflation is 5% in one year, Rs 100 will be worth Rs 95 next year (100 - 5 = 95). You want to calculate the value of Rs 10 cr in 30 years. Let’s assume the inflation rate is 6%. Now, use the compound interest formula and take the rate of growth as -6%. You will get: Today: Rs 10 cr After 30 years: Rs 1.56 cr (Taking 6% inflation). People usually do the opposite calculation. They find out how much something will cost in the future. If you search online for ‘inflation calculator’, you’ll get many websites that help you calculate the future price of something — if you don’t want to do the maths yourself. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

The mark ¨ placed over a vowel to indicate that it\\'s pronounced as a separate syllable, for example, in naïve or Brontë. 3. A break in a line of verse when the end of a word coincides with the end of the metric foot. [From Latin diaeresis, from Greek diairesis (division), from diairein (to divide), from dia- (apart) + hairein (take). Earliest documented use: 1656.] NOTES: Q. Why did the vowel wear a diaeresis to the NYC party? A. It didn\\'t want to blend in! Especially when the party was thrown by \"\"The New Yorker\"\". The diaeresis is a favorite of the magazine. Read more about it: The Curse of the Diaeresis https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis The umlaut looks the same as the diaeresis but functions differently. The umlaut changes the pronunciation of the underlying vowel as opposed to indicating separate pronunciation. See usage examples in Vocabulary.com\\'s dictionary: https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/diaeresis \"\"However, it was not until much later in life that Patrick went a step further and adopted the diaeresis which was to make the name Brontë.\"\" James Tully; The Crimes of Charlotte Bronte; Constable & Robinson; 1999.

Includes Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Russia, etc. Together, these countries decide how much oil they are going to produce. This, in turn, determines the price of crude oil. If there\\'s a lot of oil, prices are likely to be lower, and any person is likely to pay lesser for their petrol and diesel bills. Opposite is also true. 6 Day Course Theme: finance certifications Day 4: Thursday MBA. Masters of Business Administration. The MBA degree or certification has become one of the most sought-after degrees in finance. Do note that many MBA programs have specializations like HR, marketing, finance, etc. MBA can help students land many different kinds of jobs. These jobs may or may not be finance-related. Having an MBA with a specialization in finance has become a common requirement for working in the finance and banking industries. Portfolio managers are now required to have a degree in finance, law, accountancy, or business management. When this rule was brought in, many portfolio managers enrolled for MBA courses to fulfill this requirement. Missed last week\\'s course? You can downloa d the course PDF - click to download . Featured Question “…Now I want to change my mutual fund. What will the tax implications if I transfer the money to another fund (there is a option in groww app that allows you to invest the money in another fund), if 1) The other fund say ABC is of the same fund house,2) not of the same fund house.” This question has been shortened. It is a part of a longer question. Taking out money from any mutual fund in any way attracts taxes. There is no way to internally move money from one mutual fund to another mutual fund. You have to withdraw from one to invest in another. If 2 mutual funds are of the same fund house, you can use STP (systematic transfer plan) to move the money. STP allows you to move money automatically over a period of time. You have to: -specify the mutual fund from which to withdraw -specify the mutual fund to invest in -specify the amount to withdraw and invest every month There is no STP option in case the mutual funds are in different fund houses (AMCs). STP is treated like withdrawing and investing — so it will attract relevant taxes. The tax structure is different for different mutual funds and different time periods. Do check which is applicable to your investment. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

In this series of courses, you’ll learn when and how to use AI effectively for positive impact in situations where stakes are high and human lives may hang in the balance. AI for Good presents a practical framework for applying machine learning to socially important projects (and products of any kind). It illustrates this framework with several real-world examples of AI projects that are improving climate change, disaster response, and public health. AI for Good is designed to be useful whether or not you have coding experience. It does include Python code examples that you can execute and interact with to gain deeper insight into different applications. However, it doesn’t assume previous experience with AI or programming. So please recommend this to your nontechnical friends!

This specialization will help you tell the difference, so your projects reach people and better their lives. AI for Good is taught by Robert Monarch, who has applied AI in public health and disaster response for over 20 years. He has founded AI startups and shipped successful AI products at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. He’ll show you how to move your own AI projects through the stages of exploration, design, implementation, and evaluation.

One clip attacked the U.S. government for failing to take action against gun violence, while another promoted cooperation between the U.S. and China. Why it matters: Synthetic presenters potentially multiply the power of broadcast news by generating an unlimited variety of talking heads. They can appeal to specific audience segments by representing any ethnicity, gender, age, or style. And they can reach an even broader audience by speaking a variety of languages — a boon to broadcasters especially in highly multilingual Asian societies. We’re thinking: It may not be a coincidence that synthetic presenters are appearing first in countries whose people feel more positively about AI.

Generative jobs: On the help-wanted site Indeed, listings by U.S. companies that mention generative AI have jumped around 100 percent year-on-year, even as total listings declined slightly. Tech and non-tech companies alike have posted AI-job notices that mention generous salaries. For reference, the average machine learning product engineer job in the U.S. pays around $143,000 annually, according to a study by insurance company Willis Towers Watson. Wages may be lower in other countries. - Accenture mentioned a pay range between $131,000 and $338,300 for advanced AI research scientists.

The shortage prompts employers to offer high salaries in hope of attracting candidates with the skills and experience they need. That situation spells opportunity for people who put in the time, effort, and passion to develop a career in the field. We’re thinking: We’re thrilled by the number of people who are participating in AI and earning good wage. Yet there’s more to job satisfaction than maximizing your salary.

Why it matters: Tech giants are magnets for AI talent, and top employees gain valuable practical and market experience. Yet many come to feel confined by conditions within an established company. Former DeepMinders who formed their own companies cited their desire to follow currents of deep learning, such as generative AI, that their former employer doesn’t emphasize and their need for flexibility to pursue goals that didn’t necessarily revolve around machine learning. We’re thinking: While high-profile associations often attract capital and attention, great ideas can come from anywhere. They seldom happen overnight; usually, they’re the end result of a long incubation period spent honing them through experimentation and feedback. Start small and develop your intuition, skills, and credibility. That’s how pretty much everyone started who ended up having a huge impact! Different Media, Similar Embeddings The ability of OpenAI’s CLIP to produce similar embeddings of a text phrase and a matching image (such as “a photo of a cat” and a photo of a cat) opened up applications like classifying images according to labels that weren’t in the training set. A new model extends this capability to seven data types. What’s new: Rohit Girdhar, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ishan Misra, and colleagues at Meta developed ImageBind (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3psW5ds3Wp6TGBwSW1LfHWH800zFpW930MCw6N_-_7W31Z64d1-D_FCN7BPSxgslbFsW5w_lS97VMgTYW3225b-362vV4V2CnSK27tDpRW55wPF678W3nQW7Gd0pT3_QGR6W4pN2tk1qW6RBN6cBZ-lk240bW3h1jPY9c4cy_W569Kbn8XRs3TN8pJrrn5qS9nW7RDzy15zQfPHW1rypK46xsk3jW1PvqvR4rCx88W4fWpv91VwcDsW5Nj_vc4zLPxqW30xLg440F3PlW5qvWMy9lcs07d4mb0j04 ) , a system that produces similar embeddings of text phrases, audio clips, images, videos, thermal images, depth images, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) readings (which include accelerometer and gyroscope measurements). Key insight: One challenge to learning multimodal embeddings is access to training data that includes matched pairs of all data types involved. For instance, matched image-text pairs, image-depth pairs, and image-thermal pairs are readily available, but pairings of text-thermal, text-depth, and so on are not. Learning to produce similar embeddings given pairings of one media type (in this case images) with other media types will transfer to pairings of pairings of that type with further types. There’s no need for specific training for each pairing. How it works: ImageBind uses a separate transformer to embed each media type with one exception: The transformer that processes images handles video as well by treating a video as a two-frame image (sampled from the video). - The training data comprised matched pairs of video-audio (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3V83prCCW95jsWP6lZ3pzW26C73l8tR-_nW2Khs1F2DqT0YW3g-3PB96LMj5W6bv39w8qnCHtW8cGvwT3dnpcSVlWKVf4pLZYgW7qTYFC32xfGZN1b4-D33kgpWW6N9-1D6Yg_GHVKQB2-2vDGvYN1kbqp78ZJXHW68YmG74YmPgwW7Lx7wM6MMG3dW4tykQX5SKFP5W46X2Dr1cGBnTW3wSD7d8h0bCRW4JVRLc40bD3sW845D1g95kJLtW7ctlV08g1lK1W4nyDm11v0Kj4W6GXj2p1_Fn3xW1yqdrY6yPTs8W594cxR4qCBgVW4PbmhR8YkrzWVKD0KS2TLjgCW50HLdL7bvjJ-W85H2fr6PV-zWW3nqgsg14J0c2W6-g7S-2GD-XTW18Lwk78XLWWbdmYvJP04 ) clips from YouTube, image-depth (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3nDVG86vr8T_RMNN8rLMn7dH8RLW1ylGmd2XCLMKW5fzxQ_2lrrgLN1k4clhPhPQ_W3dv0_35Q9gCJW6V5xPm3nFHMvW7TCSCy7HGkPyV-drTp2hYP0rW8Jzk9N4_13RKW4m0Wxg5Y-K5gW7hw3Gm7HvmR6W4VNfzF5nXL4tN5NQSy5cJxMPW9hJQ6G5Q4JvGW74zqDS6hs7DkW93fmhN72V1VSW6d63yM4_3syjW2Bb9_R3Xj3RbW6Rv_gt7PmlxCMzSTbB7Zbj7W6QhqDC2Pft0xf2mzvmq04 ) scenes shot by a depth camera, image-thermal (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3n7W5L8dvT3k7LqjW4x_rCj2ywhn4VgBWnx5c2SlFN5HdtR85xS4PW6Y203C30Z-QDW5NVH-W5pzrp5W2-g67Y21XvN5W1drjyH1VdzDjW5kpp5n9jTvhtW5z8xfX168q6qW1pk5vZ7dbMLyW3nP0Q163MZ51N2wF8rVGbYkTVdBK-T7hJbx9W372FMQ7Svks2W6rhV9m5w5561W18LTCq5BwZcrW85vghP5vm6BlW8wYBsR8TDlxdW1SFyvQ347sRMW8-yYXz2B8P1TW5tqyzd7Dzwp9f5lXNj404 ) pictures of street scenes at night, and video-IMU (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3ncVP8JZC8Bwl41W4m4LLg3Gj8RqW3Kn4hH6z2rjkVshrpH7dFfH2W8DV0Sx1Gtbz0W3dcT0m7g2BwRW7x6f6b4XNvZdW5r9kWX5k4wbpW315_327JRlypM_zHTbmWSDGW8F4tqv31gw8XW9jpR-v5yp8NvW3VXKBf9c4dV6W8lh6hM4YKGNYW2zNY6r8kFvClW2MFxZW8Pb6fQN2k8CjxM6cWfW5TBkK14cmXDSW8flvL52GXV6BW8QZMyH1zd8lfW6jLHBw1wBThfN7sLpssjx4Zhf8sDgrq04 ) shot from a first-person point of view. - Instead of training image and text encoders from scratch, the authors adopted the encoders from OpenCLIP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3Tg3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lLW80q0Mv41Nm79W1nBvvR2fZ91HW5yBKLR3xFHmwW5zj-Dp7PFbpJW6zV_2B2pqq6KW42QD8L1-0P5LW2r4ZGp8qzmW6N7L5fp4_Z-58W3JphPb7bchBTW7Hy5m_1_Wvx9W44vBdz48PrXQW5vDZs374QJ4dW254JRD7DbkvcW7lR1Q-6N5hCJW2ldd1d8pP3BtW1Rf4Rh4wghGVW4z2nf26gJRVfW4mK3n02nQJXrW5Bthlh60TJ50N5NcSJwDQ2rhW5x6-3L7Bt3ZXW54kp2f9885d6W7TxP3d4VV9yGW3P5G358Xb91Hf7YLxkl04 ) , which is pretrained on billions of image-text pairs. - The transformers learned via a contrastive loss function. Given an image (or video) and its match in another data type, the loss encouraged them to produce similar embeddings. Given an image (or video) and an example that didn’t match, it encouraged them to produce dissimilar embeddings. Results: The authors use a method similar to CLIP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3p_W77wPTH7kwCB6N4xcqfzzPdxKVpHghm4-hFmNW49JS3t4ZDbBKW6WdD6v7qXVwJW6Zh3Zz5cNXMxW625YfQ2JdwvrW52nY_63lBPkkW94754r1JY_dtW4s2cSv8STSL6W5DkLpB4-zQYqW2HwsSQ6J8ssNW8L197s8lp1TWW5Cb93b8D7dyBW1YmxRP2zpGTCW2crcpq5pJZWNW6QnDKg3gww57W4LtC-N1cf252W3Y9CZw736zgcN17CHGLRVN6jW3pLyYb3_0Y97W6cSJg62czW9zdbfFr604 ) to classify data using ImageBind.

ImageBind returned the correct audio clip 6 percent of the time, whereas AVFIC (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3nmW2FPyzw3sxX48W666bBS29vpS-W65RnvC45dmQrW81kgmb7PJwLCW7PS7-06Vw0s7W4DLxWF6J4T2BW3GXrD89k5VtnN7X8fgJ-4lbzW7wn7Ly8BRcQsW1NqhPR6WRKHNW4c2Yfm486q4QN5DC8pzcjfWgVVntRv5vV7QDW21wZ_-5n-4K8W8Njd0274SN6CW47dtVv28Pnm6W4dQlFS57D8NQW5qlNNG2wS8VkW8GCcLs1ClGTNW57L3Vz303vRCW3NpGwl5WKrhmW22DySB8hDx9mf4BF6-j04 ) , which learned using pairs of audio and text, returned the correct audio clip 3 percent of the time. However, ImageBind did not match supervised learning. ARNLQ (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVNqW94vHzrVW5V5Shq23fqvTW1qZjFf538rYXMwF3S-3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3kVW9ffZMG5KJZNPW5GcMrV6k-RzpW18twpt7BssBZW4fBdsC42hN8kW1phx8B4_qcMBW7dr7vf3rSK_3W3Q1sjT8NZ9hfW82BCnF93RCXzN4sn-h3K0DMcW1__dM32ZhLMgW4DK8fh7d8YnRN56V2XLc_hd_W2KFv1v5CfTCSW5601vT4rf22SW5RCL4p94LBGqW5n3DsX8BnJsvW3NXDTp3zZTcpW32-vd53m76MkW7XYwDZ5Z64TgW3ls1qn2gcs8RW5yqh-72gVYPHW2lyJ433vm49Sf3G3HFR04 ) , a supervised model, returned the correct audio 12.6 percent of the time. Why it matters: The authors’ approach acts as an upgrade for models that generate similar embeddings for examples that have similar meanings in different media: To enhance to the model’s repertoire with a new data type (say, audio), simply fine-tune it on relevant paired data (such as image, audio). We’re thinking: ImageBind shows that machine learning models don’t need to learn from all pairs of data types to produce similar embeddings among various data types. Still, we can’t help but wonder how much its performance would improve if it did learn from other pairings, like (text, audio). Work With Andrew Ng Join the teams that are bringing AI to the world!

Join Medium. Hey everybody, Ever since hosting a robust Medium Day discussion on the future of AI, I’ve been fielding questions about artificial intelligence. And not just technical questions. But ethical questions. Societal questions. Economic questions. Safety questions. Writers want to know if they lose copyright by running headline options and nut graphs through ChatGPT. Educators are discussing if using apps such as Grammarly to correct run-on sentences and poor sentence structure is appropriate. Shoppers want to know if they’re talking with a human or a robot concerning their returns or their food purchases. And, I was recently talking with a programmer about the ethics of using a large language model, or LLM, to help them write their own code for work. (Sidenote: would that even work unless a human first created the code upon which the LLM is trained?) Enter data science and AI ethics expert Dr. Brandeis Marshall to the chat. “The term ‘AI’ has gotten overplayed,” Marshall writes. “Similar to the term ‘data science’ from five years ago, the word ‘AI’ is used everywhere by everybody. It has become the umbrella term for anything tech-related or tech-adjacent…. I’ve realized that it’s critically important to listen to how the majority of the room is understanding AI and in what sector/domain context.” For Ignacio de Gregorio, discussing AI means Meta’s release of Llama 2, which is a program that can debug code or check human-written codes for errors. Gregorio’s recent analysis praises the model. Meanwhile, for Luminae Steele, interrogating AI means delving into whether humans prefer human art or AI-created art. Steele reports that “that narratives and perceived effort were crucial factors” for humans deciding between the two. AI covers a lot of territory, doesn’t it? If you have an essay brewing that touches upon a specific aspect of the past or the future of this technology, I’d love to read what you have to say. See you on Medium.

To help us remember the difference between pronation and supination he explained, \"\"You hold your soup with your palm up and then you prour it out.\"\" As he said this he slowly rotated his palm from face up to face down. The explanation lived on as I used it when I taught anatomy.

I first heard the term at my son\\'s violin lesson. It is what keeps the bow pressure on the string constant as the player moves the bow toward its tip. Pronation also helps the player in the expressive use of dynamics, timbre, and the various types of bow strokes. It is not one of those things that audiences can see working, but it is a vital part of string technique. My son\\'s teacher would hold up his bow arm and say, \"\"80%\"\" (meaning the bow arm is 80% of playing the violin).

Liza Levy, Paris, Kentucky ---------------------------- From: Andrew Pressburger (andpress sympatico.ca) Subject: diaeresis Refer: https://wordsmith.org/words/diaeresis.html The use of diacritical marks in Hungarian almost doubles the number of letters that comprise the English alphabet (44 as opposed to 26). The umlaut characteristic of German orthography exists in Hungarian on top of o (ö) and u (ü). In addition, Hungarian uses other devices that alter the meaning of a word. For instance fül means ear, but fű (with the elongated diaeresis) means grass or lawn. Andrew Pressburger, Toronto, Canada ---------------------------- From: Robert Nisonger (bnisonger gmail.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--diaeresis Here in Hawai`i we use an okina https://www.iolanipalace.org/information/hawaiian-language/ to separate vowels. Robert Nisonger, Kula, Hawaii ---------------------------- From: Marco Davis (davis.marco gmail.com) Subject: diaeresis The New Yorker article you linked to is brilliant, and really provides the only rational reason for using the diaeresis any more: that is, you might drop dead if you stop. Its use in commercial/marketing contexts to make a fake word look \"\"foreign\"\" has cheapened what maybe was elegant in the New Yorker\\'s younger days, and just makes it now look a bit silly. (Examples, like fake-foreign Häagen-Dazs or the various metal bands like Blue Öyster Cult, Queensrÿche, or Mötley Crüe, put The New Yorker in weird and uncomfortable company... though maybe those fake-foreign diaereses are actually umlauts, letting The New Yorker off the hook?) Marco Davis, Orem, Utah ---------------------------- From: Alex McCrae (ajmccrae277 gmail.com) Subject: pronation and funambulism In contemplating our word pronation, I reflected upon how this simple forearm(s) rotation is such an integral part of a pro golfer\\'s backswing if done correctly, imparting considerably more club head speed toward the golf ball than if the forearms remain rigid, or locked on the initial takeaway. Tiger Woods has taken a number of pages to heart out of the legendary \"\"Bantam\"\" Ben Hogan\\'s golf instruction playbook*, particularly his imperative of making sure to pronate the forearms and wrists on the takeaway. *Ben Hogan\\'s Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53175612364/ Prior to checking out its definition, I tried to figure out the meaning of our word \"\"funambulism\"\", focusing on the embedded \"\"ambul\"\", which shows up in the more flowery word for walking, perambulation. Finally, when I did read the definition and discovered that it related to walking on a tight-rope, on-high, I arrived at this daredevilish balancing act scenario. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53175612354/ Alex McCrae, Van Nuys, California ---------------------------- Anagrams This week\\'s theme: Misleading words 1.

And who can blame it? If you have been on the go for 4.5 billion years, you are entitled to take it easy from time to time. So, yes, it is slowing down at the rate of 2.3 milliseconds per century. In about 150 million years a day will be an hour longer. A whole extra hour. Every single day, instead of only once each year when we turn the clocks back under the illusion that we are getting more daylight! What would I do with an extra hour? I don\\'t know, so many possibilities I might finally catch up on my reading. Assuming they don\\'t publish anything new in the intervening time. Conversely, the dinosaurs enjoyed only 23 hours in a day. No time at all for reading in between hunting, foraging, and dodging asteroids. No wonder they weren\\'t smart enough to ruin their own climate and environment, and thus survived for hundreds of millions of years more than we are likely to. What would _you_ do if you magically had an extra hour each day? Share on our website https://wordsmith.org/words/anachronistic.html or email us at words@wordsmith.org. As always, include your location (city, state). Meanwhile, this week in A.Word.A.Day we\\'ll look at words related to time. anachronistic (uh-nak-ruh-NIS-tik) adjective 1. Out-of-date, old-fashioned. 2. Involving something or someone in the wrong historical period. [From French anachronisme, from Latin anachronismus, from Greek anakhronismos, from ana-, (backwards) + khronos (time). Earliest documented use: 1778.] See usage examples in Vocabulary.com\\'s dictionary: https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anachronistic What\\'s Shakespeare working on? Mac-beth. https://wordsmith.org/words/images/anachronistic_large.jpg Illustration: Anu Garg + AI NOTES: An anachronistic error can be of two kinds. A parachronism is when the assigned date is too late, and prochronism is when the date is too early. Even language can be fraught with anachronism. Imagine a science fiction story where the protagonist rides a time machine to go back some 500 years. While there, he compliments someone\\'s dress, calling it \"\"nice\"\". Well, at that time the word \"\"nice\"\" would have meant \"\"stupid\"\". Sometimes anachronisms can be unintentional, a story written in 1970 and set in 2000 that features the USSR, for example.

These loans may have higher interest rates because lenders view them as riskier than secured loans. If the loan is not repaid as agreed, the lender may also begin debt collection attempts, report negative information to credit bureaus, and even initiate a lawsuit against you. 6 Day Course Theme: factors affecting interest rates Day 1: Monday We hear of interest rates mostly in two things: loans and deposits. In this week’s course, we’ll understand the factors affecting interest rates. The first thing to realize is that nearly all interest rates offered by banks (loans or deposits like FD) are all linked. They mostly move up and down together. You will see that when FD rates go up, home loan rates, car loan rates, etc. all go up. This is because these interest rates are all tied to something called the repo rate. The RBI decides the repo rate of the country — which we’ll explain tomorrow. Missed last week\\'s course?

For e.g. if Mr. X invests 5k into ABC scheme of a MF, that 5k goes exactly to whom? Who becomes shareholder of that investment, Mr. X or that AMC? On what basis units are allotted to Mr. X? How averaging helps? Please explain the entire process” When you invest in a mutual fund, the money goes to the mutual fund’s cash pool. The fund manager always keeps a pool of cash for buying new assets and also returning investor’s money. Whenever the fund manager sees a good investment opportunity to invest, they do so. But to the investor (you), it doesn’t matter. As soon as you invest, you get units. These units represent your ownership of the mutual fund’s entire holding. The shares that are purchased by the mutual fund technically belong to the mutual fund’s investors. Mutual fund companies are established with a very intricate structure to protect the interest of investors. To properly understand this, search and read about ‘3-tier structure of mutual funds’. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

Dear Friends, Join in on our panel of experts with Andrew Ng, Robert Monarch, Juan Lavista Ferres, and Iva Gumnishka to learn more about how AI is impacting the world in a positive way. AI is one of our most powerful tools when it comes to addressing the biggest challenges we face in the areas of climate change, public health, and disaster management. AI has already been deployed as a key component of many real-world applications that are having a positive impact on things like : - Making renewable energy sources a more viable alternative to fossil fuels - Providing access to reliable information in more of the world’s languages - Allowing for more effective planning, logistics, and resource allocation in the event of a disaster.

Then there\\'s kairos, the special occasion, the opportune moment to do something. In Salviati\\'s painting, notice Time putting his finger on the scale -- he can do it because it\\'s not the boring 9-5 kind of time. Rather, it\\'s the one where stars are aligned, winds are favorable, and the universe is conspiring in your favor. It\\'s meant to be. Seize the day. Kairos, the Greek god of opportunity, is putting his thumb (or finger) on the scale in your favor. What are you waiting for? \"\"Barbara said, \\'I imagined her as having entered more fully into kairos -- the appointed time, the fullness of time.

Investment Firm Word of the Day An investment firm invests money on behalf of many people in different assets (like stocks). The main goal of the firm is to give the investors returns while sticking to certain requirements of safety of capital, risk, etc. A mutual fund company is also a type of investment company. 6 Day Course Theme: factors affecting interest rates Day 2: Tuesday All interest rates are directly linked to the repo rate. The RBI decides the country’s repo rate. It is one of the tools the RBI uses to control inflation or grow the economy. When the inflation is too high, RBI increases the repo rate (thus slowing down economic growth). When economic growth becomes too low, they reduce the repo rate (thus increasing economic growth). When the pandemic hit, the repo rate was reduced to encourage more economic activity. Example: The repo rate is 4%. FD: 4.5%. Home loan rates: 6%. Car loan rates: 7%. If repo rate is increased: repo rate is 5%. FD: 5.5%. Home loan: 7%. Car loan: 8%. Missed last week\\'s course? You can downloa d the course PDF - click to download . Featured Question “Everyday you report on the 20-Year return. Please explain what this means. Lately it has been falling steadily. Does this mean the stock market is liable to fall also?” The main aim of showing 20-year returns is to show how the markets behave in the long period. We see that even on days when the market falls very sharply, the 20-year return does not change much. The same happens when the markets go up. In the long run, the markets are more stable. The 20-year returns don’t fluctuate much — that’s what it is meant to show. Do note: it does not tell us anything about what will happen in the future. It shows us what has happened in the past. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

Tax Lien Word of the Day Tax lien is a legal claim under which the government can seize a company\\'s assets if they fail to pay taxes on time. In addition to seizing the assets, the government can also put a fine on the amount. Non-taxpayers can relieve a lien by paying the due amount. 6 Day Course Theme: factors affecting interest rates Day 3: Wednesday After repo rate, one of the most important factors determining rates is risk. For higher risk, banks want higher interest rates. This is why personal loan rates are always much higher than car loan rates. And also why car loan rates are higher than home loan rates. In case of home loans, there is collateral (the home itself)— so risk is lower. In case of car loans, there is a collateral (the car) but its price is always falling — so risk is higher. All loan rates work like this — the higher the risk for the bank, the higher the interest they’ll charge. The same goes for FD too. If the investor (you) thinks the FD giver is risky, you will want a higher interest rate for the FD investment. This is why big established banks’ FD rates are lower than newer banks\\'.

Nifty on every working day changes by more than 0 percent. What does the above indicate??in 5 years ???” Many new investors are not used to the stock markets’ behavior on a day-to-day basis. We write this line to give new investors a sense of how the markets have behaved over a longer period. Example: A new investor might hear that the markets fell by 0.7% and panic. Or, he/she may hear the markets have gone up by 0.9% and feel very excited. This is meant to help new investors keep their expectations and reactions realistic. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

Guarantor Word of the Day A guarantor is a person who will pay back the loan in case the original borrower is unable to pay back. Lenders may require some borrowers to offer a guarantor when taking a loan. 6 Day Course Theme: factors affecting interest rates Day 4: Thursday Generally speaking, the longer the period of a loan, the higher the interest rates. Why? As you lend your money to someone, the chances of something going wrong increase — the risk is higher. To compensate for the higher risk, the interest rate is also kept higher. Similarly, in the case of an FD, the interest rate is higher for longer periods. This relation isn’t always true though. Many times banks don’t increase their loan rates much even for long durations. Similarly, many times banks don’t offer higher FD rates for longer periods. Missed last week\\'s course? You can downloa d the course PDF - click to download . Featured Question “The Gold rate in the groww digest is for how many grams ? Haven\\'t seen anywhere about the quantity of grams.” In India, whenever people talk about gold prices, it is for 10 grams of gold. Example: the gold price is Rs 58,400 per 10 grams of gold. But when talking of silver, the price is always for 1 kg (or 1,000 grams) of silver. Example: the silver price is Rs 70,486 per 1 kg of silver. This is in the case of gold and silver prices in India only. Abroad, the weights are different. Example: In the US, gold prices are mentioned in USD or dollars. And the weight in that case is 1 troy ounce (roughly 31 grams). ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

Outside of simply deleting data used to train a model, can the influence of that data be removed? This competition considers a realistic scenario in which an age predictor has been trained on face images, and, after training, a certain subset of the training images must be forgotten to protect the privacy or rights of the individuals concerned. Total Prizes: $50,000 Entry Deadline: November 20, 2023 Learn More Your goal is to submit code that takes as input the trained predictor, the forget and retain sets, and outputs the weights of a predictor that has unlearned the designated forget set.

Join Medium. Hey everybody, Where I live in Chicago, everybody is aware when Mexican Independence Day approaches. In fact, I mark it on my calendar. My neighbors fly green, white, and red flags from their porches, attach flags to their car hoods, and even rock color-coordinated Air Jordans to celebrate the work of Father Hidalgo back on September 16, 1810. The park districts hold parties, libraries highlight historical books, elementary schools hold productions, the city hosts an enormous parade—the whole shebang. For those unfamiliar with the Chi, it might be surprising to learn that the Second City’s second largest population is Latino and of those, the majority are Mexican-Americans or of Mexican ancestry. That Mexican Independence Day falls within the month-long U.S celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month is appropriate; after all, it’s good for everyone to learn more about our shared humanity, and our hopes, values, and dreams. The month starts on September 15 to commemorate a variety of Latin American countries that celebrate their independence around that date, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Chile. Back in 1988, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan facilitated turning Hispanic Heritage Week into Hispanic Heritage Month. Many writers on Medium embrace this idea of celebrating freedom while sharing stories and histories that interrogate—or explain—heritage and various levels of intersectionality. Argentine-born writer and diversity and inclusion expert Dani Herrera writes of the debate over the use of Latine, Latinx, Latino or Hispanic. “Our community is as beautiful as it is expansive and diverse. And yes, every single one of these identities is valid.” Author Maria Ochoa, PhD details how she feels about being an aging Chicana. At 72, she no longer hides her years. “I’m happy to be in this band of sisters, these aging American-Mexican women,” she writes, “these viejitas who value and revel in the process of growing old.” And author David Bowles, the co-creator of the powerhouse We Need Diverse Books initiative, often writes both fiction and nonfiction on his Medium page. Once, he addressed the idea of Mexican Futurism as a genre in science fiction and fantasy. I look forward to learning from those of you who share your own stories of heritage and identity on Medium. Perhaps this is a memory of the old country, or a tale proffered by great-great-grandma. Perhaps you’ve imagined a sci-fi future in a story that we all should be reading. Is that you? Feel free to tag me so I can read your stories. Also, shanah tovah umetukah to those who celebrate Rosh Hashanah. See you on Medium.

Intellectual Property Word of the Day The non-physical or intangible assets that a company or person owns are called intellectual property. They are a result of an idea being developed, conceptualized, or produced by a company or a person. Intellectual property is legally held and protected to stop usage by others without permission. Designs, copyrights, trademarks, and patents are a few examples of intellectual property. 6 Day Course Theme: factors affecting interest rates Day 5: Friday The last thing we’ll talk about in this course: supply and demand. Banks and lenders make money by giving loans. Just like investors make money by putting money in FD. (FD is basically you giving a loan to the bank). There’s always an angle of supply and demand. Say there are two banks that are similar. One is giving home loans at 7.5% and the other is giving loans at 8%. People will rush to the one offering 7.5%. So to not lose customers, the other bank will try to lower its interest rate. A similar thing happens with FDs. There are many other things that affect interest rates. The ones we’ve covered in this course are some of the main ones. Missed last week\\'s course? You can downloa d the course PDF - click to download . Featured Question “How long will this boom market continue ?” Nobody truly knows how the markets will behave in the immediate future. Even the best of experts are often wrong about this. Last year, around March 2022, many experts predicted a recession. That hasn’t happened. And we see that the markets are already climbing up. If we look at the history of the markets, we can see that markets behave very unpredictably in shorter durations. ------------------ In this section, daily, we\\'ll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.

There is still so much we don\\'t know about the function and interplay of the body\\'s approximately 37 trillion cells, which makes developing new medicines challenging. Doing so requires mapping causal links between chemical perturbations and the downstream impact on cell state, which is costly and difficult to model. We hope that better machine learning algorithms can help make this process more efficient. In this competition, you\\'ll predict how small molecules change gene expression in different cell types. Total Prizes: $100,000 Entry Deadline: November 23, 2023 Learn More Your work in helping to accurately predict chemical perturbations in new cell types could accelerate the discovery and enable the creation of new medicines to treat or cure disease.

Groww Digest Weekly 17 Sept 2023 Sensex: 67,838.63 ▲ 1.86% Nifty: 20,192.35 ▲ 1.88% John Stutter left everything and moved to California in 1839. He was from Switzerland. California (America) was a land with few people living on it. John had 50,000 acres of land which he wanted to build into his agricultural empire. In 1948, he hired a carpenter named James Marshall. James started work on a water mill. A water mill uses the flow of water – from a stream or river – to turn a wheel. This turning wheel can then be used to power something. It was used to cut big pieces of wood, to make flour, and so on. On Jan 24, 1948, the workers dug out the ground to make way for the structure. James noticed that there were a few shiny objects in the mud they dug out. He bent and looked closely. It looked like gold. James rushed to John Stutter to tell him. John confirmed with an expert – it was gold. John Stutter struck a deal with his carpenter, James Marshall. They would keep this discovery a secret. Both of them would grow rich mining gold from the site. Unfortunately for them, there were other people working at the site. The secret spread. The word “spread” is an understatement. It reached across America and even the world. The California Gold Rush In 1948, the total number of immigrants in all of California was just 1,000 people. 2 years later, this number went up to 1 lakh. Another 2 years later, it went to 3 lakh people. People from all over America quit their jobs, left their daily lives, and made the difficult journey to reach California. To dig for gold. At first, it was just Americans. But later, as the word spread, people from over 25 countries moved to California. Many caught horrible diseases. Many got robbed. Many died. Crime was common. The ones who reached searched around Stutter’s mill desperately looking for gold. Later, the search expanded into newer areas of California. Stutter and Marshall failed to make money out of this gold frenzy. Stutter’s land was overrun by miners who dug in search of gold. He spent money trying to defend his own land but was unsuccessful. Some miners struck gold – literally. There are people who earned millions of dollars in weeks (in today’s money). This is what everyone dreamt of. To strike gold and get rich – forever. Many others didn’t. This was the largest migration in American history. It was called the California Gold Rush. Asymmetric Bets Question: why did they all decide to give up their jobs/lives and move far away to a distant state? When they heard gold was “discovered”, their assumption was that there was a lot of gold. And a lot of gold means a lot of money. People did a rough calculation in their heads. How much can I gain? And, how many can I lose? The answer was: How much can I gain? – Lots. So much that they never have to work ever again. How many can I lose? – Not much. I already have so little. They were taking an asymmetric bet. A lot can be gained, but not much can be lost. It’s like, you tossing a coin: heads you lose Rs 10, tails you win Rs 100. Some of the biggest successes in the world are the results of asymmetric bets. Bill Gates started a business. -The most he could lose: whatever he had then. -The most he could gain: billions (which was much more than he had). Education itself is an asymmetric bet. -You don’t lose much educating yourself. -But the gains you could make are multi-fold. Investment – be it your money, time, or effort – should ideally be towards asymmetric bets. Mind you, there are negative asymmetric bets — where you don’t gain much but can lose a lot. One of the easiest examples is rash driving: you might save some time. But if something goes wrong, you could meet with an accident. These are the bets that should be avoided. California With the gold rush, many merchants realized they could do good business in California. These merchants didn’t come to mine gold. They came to do business with the miners. The jeans brand Levi’s? That was started in California. They sold work clothes to miners. This ‘work cloth’ (jeans) is what is fashionable today. Many other businesses came. Soon, small towns started to be settled. Those became cities and California evolved from a gold rush state to a state with giant businesses. People from all over the world (and even from within America) want to move to California. Today, the state houses some of the biggest companies in the world. Apple, Google, and Meta (Facebook) are all based in California. Its GDP is over $3 trillion dollars – almost the same as India’s. A US state that is twice the size of Gujarat has a GDP similar to that of India. It started with people taking an asymmetric bet. 🔢 Quick Takes +India\\'s trade deficit stood at $24.16 billion in August, 2.8% lower compared to Aug 2022 (lower is better). +India’s wholesale inflation was -0.52% (prices fell) in Aug.

I asked our readers this week. They shared examples, from movies, books, and television, but also from the Book of Mormon, and beyond. Here\\'s a selection. In one episode of \"\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"\", Picard is working on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. After the airing of that episode, it was proven (it needed a patch, but after that, held). Also, the mention of horses in North America in the \"\"Book of Mormon\"\" -- before any had been introduced. I always found that funny. -Dr. John M. Styers, Owatonna, Minnesota (yakuzalord69 gmail.com) In the recent blockbuster movie \"\"Oppenheimer\"\", I noticed that some of the American flags waved at the celebration party featured 50 stars, but at the time there were only 48. I still have a pre-Hawaii/Alaska flag inherited from my great aunt, which I fly anachronistically each Jul 4. -Marco Davis, Orem, Utah (davis.marco gmail.com) In the 1968 film, \"\"The Devil\\'s Brigade\"\", the Canadian troops march into Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana in 1942 with a maple leaf flag flying proudly. It was not adopted as the Canadian flag until 1965. -Bob Gordon, Brantford, Canada (bob34g gmail.com) When I viewed a rerun of \"\"Blade Runner\"\" a few years ago, it was noticeable that no one was using cell phones. Not 2019 at all. -Georgiana Hanselmann, Zurich, Switzerland (georgiana.ha bluewin.ch) According to IMDb http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054331/goofs in the movie \"\"Spartacus\"\", there is a scene where the slave Antoninus (played by Tony Curtis) is seen wearing a Rolex watch. In watching out for movie anachronisms, they should have had him wearing a wrist sundial instead! -David Mezzera, Vallejo, California (damezz comcast.net) Email of the Week -- Brought to you buy One Up! -- \"\"The best game in the game.\"\" https://oldscoolcompany.com/products/one-up My husband and I visited St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2017. As we wandered the grounds, I saw a costumed gentleman scrolling on his phone. I loved the anachronistic quality of it and quickly snapped a couple of photos. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53185548417/ -Joanne Gilmore, Upper Sandusky, Ohio (gilmjo email.com) My favourite, which many people would not notice, is in numerous TV films set in the 1920s and 1930s (Agatha Christie crime stories are frequent examples). The producers go to great lengths to make everything look and sound right for the period, but then in the background we hear a cooing collared dove https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/collared-dove/ . The species was totally unknown in this country until the first pair arrived in 1956, but they are now common. -Jim Fisher, Londonderry, UK (ejf jimella.co.uk) As a teenager coming along in the \\'60s, nothing depicted a future that I might actually live to see as much as Stanley Kubrick\\'s movie \"\"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\", and to a lesser degree the \\'70s TV show, \"\"Space 1999\"\". Those very titles, pointing to the new millennium, now seem oddly anachronistic. -Russell Lott, Hattiesburg, Mississippi (russellwlott comcast.net) Probably many readers will wistfully recall \"\"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\"\\'s Pan Am Space Clipper transporting travelers to an Earth-orbit space station. Who would have foreseen that Pan American World Airways would no longer fly after 1991? And many more are likely to cheer the Society for Creative Anachronism, in which contact lens-wearing mortals with fillings in their teeth and sneakers protecting their feet can pretend they live in the Middle Ages, cheerfully savoring its creative parts (dramatic clothing and martial arts, for example) unhampered by its miseries (plague, illiteracy, deadly warfare, etc.) and inconveniences (assembling that intricate clothing without a sewing machine). -Nancy Meyer, Mundelein, Illinois (antares11 juno.com) A good example of anachronism are summer Renaissance Faires which feature characters passing themselves off as Knights of the Round Table (which would place them in the 5th or 6th Centuries) or Robin Hood and Maid Marian (which would place them in the late 12th Century). Yet, the historical Renaissance period is generally placed from the 14th to 17th Centuries. I attended one of these events and saw men in suits of armor with flintlock pistols, which would be equivalent to soldiers at Bunker Hill armed with assault rifles. -Robert P. Darling, Beloit, Wisconsin (rpdarlingdds charter.net) To comment on the meaning of \"\"nice\"\" 500 years ago -- the recent (hilarious) series \"\"Good Omens\"\" is built around a book entitled, \"\"The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter\"\", written in 1655. It is supposed to be the only entirely accurate book of prophecies ever written. I think Agnes would have been rather insulted if the title were actually \"\"The Stupid and Accurate Prophecies\"\" (besides being an oxymoron). -Royal Harrison, La Canada, California (searex earthlink.net) \"\"Period\"\" costumes with zippers (in movies set in the 19th century) are a common anachronism. The designers are more accurate now, thanks to people like Theodora Van Runkle, a brilliant costume designer. Many novels from the 21st century that are set in 19th century England use slangy 20th-century American locution. Just the fact that I notice it means I myself am anachronistic. -Cindy Watter, Napa, California (hedgehogccw gmail.com) A book I like is \"\"The Wyndham Case\"\", the first of Jill Paton Walsh\\'s mysteries starring her Cambridge college nurse Imogen Quy. (Jill also was chosen to write books starring Dorothy L Sayers\\'s Peter Wimsey characters.) The essence of \"\"The Wyndham Case\"\" is ignorance of how dates have been changed over the last few centuries, with resulting anachronistic misunderstandings that have significant real-world implications. I am a retired mathematician, and I also like the relevance of mathematics in a couple of the Imogen Quy stories! -Bob Wilson, Fitchburg, Wisconsin (wilson math.wisc.edu) There is a time-travel book called \"\"Doomsday Book\"\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Book_(novel) written in 1992 by Connie Willis which has a number of anachronisms in it. It is set in 2054, and the most glaring anachronism is that mobile phones don\\'t exist! Telephones are still attached to places rather than people and the characters spend a lot of time trying to get people on the phone and finding they\\'re not there. This sets up all sorts of communication obstacles that simply wouldn\\'t exist today. -Debbie Evans, Wellington, New Zealand (kiwidebbieevans outlook.com) That famous anachronistic water bottle in this Downton Abbey promo photo: https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/news/see-dowton-abbey-casts-cheeky-response-water-bottle-215400902.html -Jane Freeman, New York, New York (wordplayjane yahoo.com) I find anachronisms often in even carefully researched historical novels. And, of course, \"\"futuristic\"\" science fiction written in the early days is full of customs that have (mostly and thankfully) died out, such as smoking and the breezy denigration of women. In the former category, the popular (and very good if forgotten) British novelist Marguerite Steen, in her once wildly successful novel \"\"The Sun is My Undoing\"\", set in Bristol in the eighteenth century, has a woman wearing a magenta gown. Impossible. The hue called \"\"magenta\"\" was undoubtedly around in nature for a long time, but the actual dye only became possible in the nineteenth century, when aniline dyes were invented. It was named, for some reason, for a battle in Magenta, Italy in 1859. https://wordsmith.org/words/magenta.html -Judith Judson, Pittsford, New York (jjudson frontier.com) In the 1972 movie, \"\"The Valachi Papers\"\", there\\'s a scene that takes place in New York City during Prohibition. A mobster\\'s car goes flying off the road into the East River. There in the background are the Twin Towers. Rather poignant, since I\\'m sending this on 9/11/23. -Danny Magowan, Baldwinsville, New York (rmagowan twcny.rr.com) My favorite anachronism is from the futuristic cartoon \"\"The Jetsons\"\". I\\'m sure there are many. Even to a kid in the 70s, that was part of its goofy charm. In the opening theme song, dear old dad George is sitting at breakfast reading the newspaper. Looking at it today, it\\'s almost painfully quaint. The digital takeover we are going through was hardly conceivable in the 60s when the cartoonist was imagining the future. -Jennifer Stiever, Lewisville, Texas (jenbaby68 hotmail.com) During 1950-1962, James Blish published \"\"Cities in Flight\"\", a series of novels about the future of civilization several thousand years in the future. Two very obvious anachronisms: the computers which ran each city could not speak to the computers of any other city, and the City Manager used a slide rule! -Robin DeLuca, Florida (rrd335 yahoo.com) Anachronism: The Republican Party. -Eric Mills, Toronto, Canada (erics web.net) ---------------------------- From: Jeremy Carter (ddgr815 protonmail.ch) Subject: the speed of time Earth may be slowing down in general, but we\\'ve just recently had our shortest/fastest day recorded: https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/shortest-day-2022 Jeremy Carter, Detroit, Michigan ---------------------------- From: Gary Loew (garywloew gmail.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--anachronistic Back in my college days (six-tenths of a century ago), I tried an experiment. I shifted to a 30-hour day! I would stay up 24 hours and sleep six. Since my typical habit was six hours of sleep a day, it felt like I\\'d added six hours to every day. My class schedule that semester facilitated such variation and I experienced no untoward circadian problems. As it worked out, five earth days were four Gary days. My productivity was enhanced and I got some of the best grades of my college career. Now that I\\'m \"\"retired\"\" and writing a (very large) book, I\\'m often tempted to revisit my experiment. Alas, living as I do with a spouse and having something of a social life rather precludes such investigation. We are, as I have learned over the years, rather more flexible than we might have expected. Gary Loew, Atlanta, Georgia ---------------------------- From: Glenn Glazer (glenn.glazer gmail.com) Subject: Zoos and aquariums A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: All zoos actually offer the public, in return for the taxes spent upon them, is a form of idle witless amusement, compared to which a visit to the state penitentiary, or even a state legislature in session, is informing, stimulating, and ennobling. -H.L. Mencken, writer, editor, and critic (12 Sep 1880-1956) The thought for today reminded me of this quotation from performance artist Laurie Anderson: John Lilly, the guy who says he can talk to dolphins, said he was in an aquarium, and he was talking to a big whale who was swimming around and around in his tank. And the whale kept asking him questions telepathically. And one of the questions the whale kept asking was: \"\"Do all oceans have walls?\"\" Glenn Glazer, Felton, California ---------------------------- From: Tracy Blues (blues.tracy gmail.com) Subject: The Kairos Document in South Africa From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s I worked for an organisation that grew out of the South African Kairos Document. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53187748755/ Our work involved education and support for young political activists trying to evade capture and detention by the apartheid security police. As a result of their anti-apartheid activities, the students could not live in their home towns nor could they complete their education in conventional schools. I had never considered the name of the Kairos Document until today, just followed its calls to action: active involvement with the campaigns of the oppressed towards dismantling apartheid, direct participation in the fight for a just and democratic society, and special projects to address the needs of people in the struggle for liberation in South Africa. The South African Kairos Document of 1985 was a theological comment on the political crisis of apartheid. The theologians who developed this challenge to the Church named themselves Kairos theologians because they saw 1985 as a time of judgement, a crisis, a moment of truth, an opportunity for decisive action and fundamental change. The Kairos Document was an attempt to critique the prevailing theological models that determined Church activities. It countered the South African apartheid state\\'s own theology, which justified the status quo of racism, injustice, and oppression. It tried to develop an alternative model that would lead to activities that made a real difference to the future of South Africa. I am grateful I could participate in that kairos. Tracy Blues, Cape Town, South Africa ---------------------------- From: John Craw (thecrawh gmail.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--kairos Refer: https://wordsmith.org/words/kairos.html I learned this word from a comic book (probably Marvel): a new person with superpowers is being shown around an area which has other folks practicing their superpowers. One is sitting cross-legged looking at a car-sized boulder. The guide explains, \"\"He\\'s looking for the kairos -- the weak point in the rock that will allow it to be broken.\"\" Later he touches the boulder and it crumbles into a pile of sand. John Craw, Glenford, Ohio ---------------------------- From: Glenn Glazer (glenn.glazer gmail.com) Subject: epoch Refer: https://wordsmith.org/words/epoch.html Anyone who has ever used a UNIX operating system knows that the epoch is Jan 1, 1970 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time . Glenn Glazer, Felton, California ---------------------------- From: Annaliese Anesbury (aanesb01 gmail.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--epoch In cognitive neuroscience, the word epoch is used regularly to refer to a specific time window derived from continuous brain activity. It is time-locked to an event, so we can understand what your brain is doing whilst you are looking, hearing or processing any form of stimulus in your environment. You could say that an epoch is the window to the brain, showing us how our biology contributes to our subjective experience as humans, as we move through the world. Annaliese Anesbury, Adelaide, Australia ---------------------------- From: Haroon Rahimi (hrahimi9 gmail.com) Subject: Return to AWAD I was one of the original subscribers as a young adult in the days of AOL in the late 1990s. I somehow lost my subscription over time and went with other sources until a few weeks ago, when I remembered the acronym AWAD and the name Anu. Luckily, I rediscovered your service and am happy to see you\\'re still going strong. It\\'s as if a piece of my childhood and my early experiences on the Internet have been restored. Haroon Rahimi, New Jersey ---------------------------- From: Alex McCrae (ajmccrae277 gmail.com) Subject: anachronistic and epoch The word anachronistic inspired this scenario of a hippie-style fashion revival, the adoptees of this retro craze likely sticking out like sore thumbs, or more pointedly, dinosaurs from the flower-power-infused, drug-addled \\'60s. Perhaps to mask the lingering foul odor of weed, the undisputed hippie fragrance of choice was patchouli oil. IMHO, an acquired taste, and a sure-fire signal that a hippie was close by. Ha! https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53185933726/ As a fairly astute student of art history, the word \"\"epoch\"\" conjured up a particularly vibrant era of creativity, straddling the 19th and 20th centuries. This period was known as La Belle Époque (The Beautiful Era), exemplified in France, Britain and other European countries by the flourishing of the Art Nouveau movement. Such artists as Alphonse Mucha (Czech), Aubrey Beardsley (English), Victor Horta (Belgian), Charles Rennie Mackintosh (Scottish) and Antoni Gaudi (Spanish) were some of the most stellar practitioners of this organic, arabesque style, reflected in architecture, graphic design, interior design, glass art, jewelry and metalworks. Mother Nature was their abiding muse. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53185223747/ Alex McCrae, Van Nuys, California ---------------------------- Anagrams This week\\'s theme: Words related to time 1.

Distinctly we see the difference of the colors, but where exactly does the one first blendingly enter into the other? So with sanity and insanity. Sanity and insanity, Melville knew something about that. In another of his novels, \"\"Moby-Dick\"\", he depicted the insane Captain Ahab so well. Ahab destroyed everything in his obsession with the white whale, including the people around him. The whole ship. Like the blurry line between sanity and insanity, who in the world these days could have drawn the line where fiction ends and real life begins? Melville\\'s mad character was naturally tanned; his latter-day counterpart come to life is spray painted in a fake orange tint. This former captain is willing to destroy everything in his obsession with the White House. So many around him have already paid for it, so many are going to pay for it, yet so many haven’t learned the lesson yet. In his mad fixation, this man is willing to sink the whole ship too.

How can we decide which concrete use cases to build? If you’re helping a business figure out where to apply AI, I’ve found the following recipe useful as a brainstorming aid: - Consider the jobs of the company’s employees and contractors, and break down the jobs into tasks. - Examine each commonly done task to see if it’s amenable to either assistance (augmentation) or automation using AI tools such as supervised learning or generative AI. - Assess the value of doing so. Rather than thinking of AI as automating jobs — a common narrative in the popular press and in conversations about AI leading to job losses — it’s more useful to think about jobs as collections of tasks, and to analyze AI’s ability to augment or automate individual tasks. This approach is based on a method (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5x3prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3pRW2gjV8F40WCHrW18Yh108_tTlVW5bvVxG7lDPDgW80yknb8lXM4mW7FLZSc2nl826VgYHsg8dmXLCV11sj21fdqSPW9gNP026zxlLNW5khNGr1rHMpkVmb7tS7YCX-3V1C5C_2NTY_wW2K3Yzg559lQzW12SXfd8YV54JW8y_7NW5p5f8yVzg_sD8GQ3KpN4RpQM2tkm56N7kLJgqJLgNTW6gz_pC5LLy6LW8bK7G88XCDYtVX0Vyr1QXSN4TJv9Y8RNzbDN95xWHFzkhC9W4HdGS-1R7KQcW2Qttk36QKDbXW957kBh37D8mHW5NPdBr6W-skcf7rnmBv04 ) developed by Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock for understanding the impact of AI on the economy. Other researchers have used it to understand the impact of generative AI (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mKV4P8g97FyHvDW3rp7-k8MJdMTW3rg_9G2kBQ4nW7t18K_46FSPZW5bD8XT8cBCQlW5YBL-f37cqxKN6M_FcXtSRCtW2h9R6L4R80-jW7Rlt414ym_4MW1vks4p3tJmBpW6VR0NG7R54CpW73XxDZ435rF5Mt2t8L9ktgPW5j389b6R9SWyW2fYl-_6PWSZ4W6hfw_55c33qQW8bGfDp883yDGW3_Bfpb2XpwV0W2gLyW63gV2xtW4xF1zQ9bTwK-W7Ccpml4xKz5sW7tN24h1YQTbGf3Mpgrq04 ) . Workhelix, an AI Fund portfolio company co-founded by Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee, James Milin, and Rock, uses it to help enterprises asses their generative AI opportunities. In addition to economic analyses, I’ve found this approach useful for brainstorming project ideas. For example, how can AI be used to automate software businesses? Can it do the job of a computer programmer? Typically, we think of computer programmers as writing code, but actually they perform a variety of tasks. According to O*NET, an online database of jobs and their associated tasks sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce, programmers perform 17 tasks (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3p0VyWr5g92JNqYW3Q_p2r2Lc79MW4ny46r1MKJJpW7QkR1H7Wqm9DW6vvnL44FsD2JW496zhF66PgTMW5Mkf4x50g7vxW3H7qmf2zlzNlW665LLr43-1ggVYQ2fB4XgCZ7W7YdWK92yymhWW8K6LNl6TZ6l1W3JWrWF82KRRxW6HgFWT23Df43W1qvDJ-24D7c5W6jr8Bs3ynmbrW19F1k72Pf23YV4FQfx4SDg7wW7SxTG97h75yLW6Np78K9gwtVXW1k4xR99jn4QyW4S3Gnx1YLDnbW7M7LFk1vCHWBW7Q18Fj7FLZtff5K1xNl04 ) . These include: - Writing programs - Debugging - Consulting with others to clarify program intent - Conducting trial runs of programs - Writing documentation and so on. Clearly systems like GitHub Copilot can automate some writing of code. Automating the writing of documentation may be much easier, so an AI team building tools for programmers might consider that too. However, if consulting to clarify the intent behind a program turns out to be hard for AI, we might assign that a lower priority. Another example: Can AI do the job of a radiologist? When thinking through AI’s impact on a profession, many people gravitate to the tasks that are most unique about that profession, such as interpreting radiological images. But according to O*NET, radiologists carry out 30 tasks (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3pNW27CWk13WyQz1W8GPjw25s07ZGN3SyM82CtcsrW41rbjD5QjY9TW6rYvcp3zpDR5W5tbsmS4DvNXyW1VD2h28hGXzqW4wJNHp5ZSzYMVB3z1k8z6bPNW6v37ZY5QqRK2W1wvskp1nvyS-W50NTvR2DHNgpW6BnK-03NHJQcW6f2PTF1rBcPyW3SMqwN2Swyr5W1KZdJ75xPMRpW7wTwqK24fV7pW72WPgK8-Qs1HMhtS1y44f52W7r5Gr78mswK9W8qFrpZ5VrTWyN4s0RQHH7XBjW1fS17c4p7p1YW8M4f-b8g4vqkf4S2pWR04 ) . By taking a broader look at these tasks, we might identify ones that are easier or more valuable to automate. For example, while AI has made exciting progress in interpreting radiological images, part of this task remains challenging to fully automate. Are there other tasks on the list that might be more amenable to automation, such as obtaining patient histories? O*NET listings are a helpful starting point, but they’re also a bit generic. If you’re carrying out this type of analysis, you’re likely to get better results if you capture an accurate understanding of tasks carried out by employees of the specific company you’re working with. An unfortunate side effect of this approach is that it tends to find human tasks to automate rather than creative applications that no one is working on. Brynjolfsson laments that this leads to the Turing Trap whereby we tend to use AI to do human work rather than come up with tasks no human is doing. But sometimes, if we can do something that humans do but do it 10,000x faster and cheaper, it changes the nature of the business. For example, email automated the task of transmitting messages. But it didn’t make the postal system cheaper; instead it changed what and how frequently we communicate. Web search automated the task of finding articles. Not only did this make librarians more effective, it also changed how we access information. So even if AI tackles a task that humans perform, it could still lead to revolutionary change for a business. Many jobs in which some tasks can be automated aren’t likely to go away. Instead, AI will augment human labor while humans continue to focus on the things they do better. However, jobs that are mostly or fully automatable may disappear, putting people out of work. In such cases, as a society, we have a duty to take care of the people whose livelihoods are affected, to make sure they have a safety net and an opportunity to reskill and keep contributing. Meanwhile, lowering the cost of delivering certain services is bound to increase the demand for some jobs, just as the invention of the car led to a huge explosion in the number of driving jobs. In this way, AI will create many jobs as well as destroy some. Some programmers worry that generative AI will automate their jobs. However, programming involves enough different tasks, some of which are hard to automate, that I find it very unlikely that AI will automate these jobs anytime soon. Pursuing a long-term career in software is still a great choice, but we should be sure to adopt AI tools in our work. Many professions will be here for a long time, but workers who know how to use AI effectively will replace workers who don’t. I hope you find this framework useful when you’re coming up with ideas for AI projects. If our projects affect someone else’s work, let’s work hard to protect people’s livelihoods. I hope that by building AI systems, we can create — and fairly share — value for everyone. Keep learning! Andrew News Music Generation For the Masses Text-to-music generation has arrived.

The service is free for 20 generations per month up to 45 seconds long. The professional tier allows 500 generations per month, up to 90 seconds long, for $11.99 per month. An enterprise tier is negotiable. The company said it would open-source the model eventually. How it works: Stable Audio is a latent diffusion (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mSW3_8fKM1YMvn_W4gC1gj209DVbW7nwttP3FgCvYW8_ssNg8-zPtrW17XRmX6G7WtZW4LdvpQ4GMmRgW3PtMBG6KV2C5W3HLC7B6H0PWZN2BkXXQ4HySsW7FwlyJ1D51YRW2Kt6466VZjb_W2TV27k8_v_cKW1DRQmw1gxWvhVFYql48_KvJWMgZrGylsvKgW4yw0v99cgFLmW62TcBX8GgsvhW7TPJXF90zXCMW2MJKXv5My12fW7TWZ7L3Mk56JN288tjh4vmjTW95Ym782tz7hrf3nyhDq04 ) model. It generates audio by a process that’s similar to the way Stable Diffusion generates images, but it uses a variational autoencoder to map audio to an embedding for processing and back to audio for your listening pleasure. The authors trained the system on 800,000 audio files (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pSN7ydTKKFyKktW4_ftc78rCwNGN65pS9RWjJj3W8MF79F3knn_pW67fcTd7NcG3HW2KQy4c7SkGKQW1hk7wj27zVWrW9dHz_f4wMrJTV9d9pH70R0LCVjcCYN5ytRxLW28FfCj3SXr8BW208QW42g8wKbW6PGzVQ1vcHwFW2q7FBG7kzr1jW3bthl97NjsVFW6CWrZY5bk7-6W3m65lV1L0TWpVT6hBN5P3n8SW7qMM9Y7wCHW3W8BpG4k5HwNl7W5nCfwM5lsRVcW8Cl3bF4rwZCldfzXWx04 ) containing music, sound effects, and performances on individual instruments and corresponding descriptions. - During training, a variational autoencoder (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3nmW25p--c516RTjW98G-YW7xs3FBW81vd2f4YFFHFW91SfNJ8m7dKfW3K6L_V3LTbTYW8hbbYr9cKt9bW3nT9hq6Bv09rW1R62F01ys1FNW8n9T1x2rSR7ZN4pscPH7Ry6JN8vKsqfSySgYN8H1kX6VdmhNW5-TX1Q58-927W58BV8Z8lHKTDN3zJ6T1X1d8zW3Y2vwV76mCQNN7-7XkNJj4TdW8dcM7L6sKhsyW6GZ-L63B9f4rW56mZFd5RF5kyW6Hr7zf1X_sSRW6cv2VF6M6X6-N6p8nCkrmhJHN3R9P99RXwhpf5jcgpY04 ) learns small embedding representations of audio examples. - A CLAP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pTW7VDwyH3qXK_9N8bVBw2yBpypW7xfG-k4nHlMdN1B6ND0MRlmQW1NPRlj3VhSR1W7D3tTP1XHGQsW1hmBtQ3jq3DgW22JrGy6d0PNmW8WK8yq8c_9nsW4Nq9Rd9hLYlbW1qlY8L1LHRJ5W47T1kQ5sh1bpN31k82rqlP25W8-tXXy8hWGNHW68VVKw1clnY5W1bH8Pf15YYQtVJmcCk2yg9YQW1cmlh54j848BVW4TSS8z1KGpW1ZSDmD8P32KjVfQ51B8x9V3vW5RjqKv7Scv1Df5g4D9q04 ) transformer pretrained on their dataset produces an embedding for text that describes musical characteristics like style, instrumentation, tempo, mood, or any sort of description. Separate embedding layers represent the duration of the audio to be generated and how many seconds into a given audio file the current training example starts. The latter helps the model to learn how musical compositions are expressed over time. - Stable Audio adds noise to the audio vector. A U-Net (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pWW8dxjTx4d2DVqW35WY2k1Bl_x4W1YZSj-85DNC-N1NWHY5NtRs1W81Fzp06vKhZ8W2L7gGB1wkcYRN2S2yZGF9F-sW4-nCGB7DNzD6VgZ-qm9cpz2jW64ltd83lMrZcN5yc2KhYpWDTW97krkL5CNhgHW8t5P0s9fTtyGW6K4TxF5fgNNnW3LhfDz1HgkwkW8W8yw-3zrTxFW8gFpWV4_c_mGW68vPWG4G4gSZW5YRqv21XQxtTW4Ygpg_22kR-YN5SFcRNjdDz8W1WZzP09956FPf4G4hgC04 ) convolutional neural network learns to estimate the added noise and remove it according to the text and timing embeddings. - At inference, the system starts with a pure-noise embedding and a user-prompted descriptive text and output file length. It removes noise iteratively to produce an embedding of the generated audio. From that embedding, the decoder from the variational autoencoder produces the audio at CD-quality (16-bit, 44.1kHz, stereo) resolution.

The researchers guided generation using metadata including artist, lyrics, and style. Yes, but: Stable Audio excels when generating instrumental and ambient music, but its output tends to suffer from some of the same flaws as previous text-to-music generators: Longer outputs often lack a coherent structure, and the clarity and detail of individual instruments and sound effects varies wildly. It also doesn’t effectively generate the sound of a vocalist pronouncing words. Why it matters: AI has demonstrated its prowess at generating convincing text and images. Generated audio has implications for producers not only of music but also of videos, video games, and podcasts. Stable Audio sounds like an early step, but it stands out for its speed, high-resolution output, and the inclusion of a mechanism for learning musical structure. We\\'re thinking: Stable Audio is impressive, but this doesn’t quite feel like music’s GPT moment. Text and image generation took off as soon as highly capable generative models appeared. Music generation may yet await models that can produce not only high-res output but also sonorities and structures coherent and varied enough to be widely useful. Machine Translation at the Border For some asylum seekers, machine translation errors may make the difference between protection and deportation.

Faulty translations are jeopardizing applications, The Guardian reported (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5R3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3l4W61sl281-tLfTW27DLGK4G6JV3W55d84M97vS40W8bbR7z7RZFRFW3P2m202xRSmcW58yJXY97nmnvW1gJP7c1nc4JWW5YS9737JZ-sLW6r2g_c91_Zn7W1MQwHF3KrylBN57W-pKVQ9PBW56QL3-8--1zqW7SCd8z7ZGX3zW1DRfVY56fG-RW2lzXjz2M0sMpW1Rd-vY4kpRSCW86H8Tw89QSfgMZTByNyfgtYW5NSmyS7yl2pmW7HXrdl1pnYBxN849NQbyPcFtW3Z3bYc8-f4lYW4vQfW51RkB5QW6hVypQ42NWXxW7Wn9tJ7wZFl7W5lb67G8-cy-qW2tyBRS1_z5xcW2dxxGw5hkB0df6CkXm204 ) . How it works: The Department of Homeland Security has said it would provide human translators to asylum seekers with limited English proficiency, but this doesn’t always happen. They often resort to machine translation instead. - Immigration authorities use a variety of models.

For example, models sometimes translate first-person pronouns from asylum seekers’ native languages into “we” in English, leading authorities to believe that multiple people filed an application, which is illegal. In one instance, authorities dismissed a woman’s application after a translator rendered a colloquial reference for her abusive father as her “boss.” - Some translations are barely comprehensible. An illiterate Brazilian Portuguese speaker was separated from his family and subsequently detained because a model mistranslated his asylum application into gibberish. Behind the news: Diverse factors can mar a translation model’s output: - Even widely spoken languages may suffer from a lack of training data. For instance, on Wikipedia, roughly the same number of articles are written in Swahili, which is spoken by roughly 80 million people, as Breton, a language with fewer than 250,000 speakers. - Many models are trained to translate among several languages using English as an intermediary, but English words don’t always account for meanings in other languages. For instance, English uses one word for rice, while Swahili and Japanese have different words for cooked and uncooked rice. This may cause inaccurate or nonsensical Swahili-to-Japanese translations of sentences that include “rice.” - A model trained on a language’s formal variation may not translate casual usage accurately. A translator trained on a language’s most common dialect may output more errors faced with a less common one. - Translations of spoken language may suffer if a model’s training data did not contain audio examples of the speaker’s accent, pitch, volume, or pace. Why it matters: Machine translation has come a long way in recent years, (as has the U.S. government’s embrace of AI (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3ksW56tc8V4vtmKJW3Vkyrk4TW4jcVpW4LD8YmmncW6q-Q5867GpPgN60gVP3d9t_KW7Fqzj18twL7FN3R-YXHB3bL9N5J3jgRyjZCXW4JLMpm4_v1YKW7XqR5M2k41gsV7D_Lj2zGvX4W7wVkBb5dQBzdW5FXWrJ8kVXVbVvY8sq15kj9HW379Ymc3cbhRtW4mCrjQ23pww0W2WF0p957L_QdW6dkpff6cqQ1jW8H5Gg01w2b2XW955fdb4qY5TcW7KgLXv1_5K2ZW6p8dY15blk02W5H0DYW3x6ZQBVj0nwY8WMNXLf7ZcKtb04 ) to streamline immigration). Yet the latest models, as impressive as they are, were not designed for specialized uses like interviewing asylum candidates at border crossings, where people may express themselves in atypical ways because they’re exhausted, disoriented, or fearful. We’re thinking: Justice demands that asylum seekers have their cases heard accurately. We call for significantly greater investment in translation technology, border-crossing workflows, and human-in-the-loop systems to make sure migrants are treated kindly and fairly.

What\\'s new: Amin Ghiasi and colleagues at the University of Maryland visualized representations learned by a vision transformer (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mrW6kx-5y27zrfdW6S_3nZ71SD8CW6_NJbL3mypsLW4Ppprt417BFVW51VW-f4Nj9vRW4wm68Q9kj4qQW6BtV9b7fvKDpW2XptFG83CRdbW76FdXc2fVFsYW116Zmr77-l4JW241XDs3BCcv2W3Sn_KP7h-yPdW6YBk8Z8891J8W6Rywqx1qFWS9N43SzqyWvGz3MkNMBJKbYcQN3RmMJnx0WhkW11kS9F2Rq7ShW6P_q_62GTGpGVKXYYh5gKYcmW3qJF3g8LMLzKW6w1lTn1yxGCTf1d7LVl04 ) . The authors compared their results to earlier visualizations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Key insight: A method that has been used to visualize the internal workings of CNNs (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3mLW2WQVHy5bkSMtW2rkGKz1v52r_W1LH9Nd3qYBs4V4-Brb3DZ0KMW5QG5SC31_nk_N20tCpkkKHXjVNvgVv61H3RLW5fswFt77VqyBW65_42X3zVK2DW1Zmcyh8WYhfJW3j4Tcl3rKXwyN5FtdkczmN08W5SvRxb2TZ85cW2lpMCy1bWny5W3dxkv97SfZ7dW6kBsD-8-b0RKW43B-8-2bjc5FW4KS6v14lLVGrW1q4-Yp2vM4pHW8ZQ0bN5BnhkRW1YgM7B3Pf7yMW4DQgqt7CJ7DpW35FPvx3hTKzGV6R6Cq1PSRMcf6V52MC04 ) can also reveal what’s happening inside transformers: Feeding the network images that maximize the output of a particular neuron (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk425m_5PW50kH_H6lZ3kDW2shv--89W-npW9hcQyn2GNGSJW6DVnX367MyX3W4VMXG42WzJ6ZW7TvRkd77ZNWBW8WRLcZ1SnD5TW2znmRh3219F_W3myC_y6lzM5WW4bSdv18Mg8DVW452Vn0147Fn4W82pCpJ2qfBv-W3CgFMW6LWjjRW5-gbjS35QXJCN3gdZjFlMy1SW7lyCL33T76kZW2n8Th-78JHysN8jTmrq92Gl5W25jzxc7ZbwMKW8_P9pY2xY8_PW5-fSfq4p-qNzW8xcck94_t914W3XXlqz6BqWZNW3-Vjyk1w9-gDW2Q-j6m1mcx8VW6MqdQl3dqJDvW88t0y76Kjhz6W8n97tp4n1p5FW7cClgt3dxWKjW8j11J52QLCRtW3c6Qkn1yFJG_W63pm3W41v4zDLxHNqtj4mvf7Dvtx-04 ) makes it possible to determine what individual neurons contribute to the network’s output. For instance, neurons in earlier layers may generate high outputs in response to an image with a certain texture, while neurons in later layers may generate high outputs in response to images of a particular object. Such results would suggest that earlier layers identify textures, and later layers combine those textures to represent objects. How it works: The authors experimented with a pretrained (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lZN6wQw6GcbC7HW1r_Stt6Ml9FfW1qmxmt5cVScGW5ZXsCb5F3Rb9W66qcK06G_kHWW7kY53F4FT8mNW5rT4Sg6dRFVnW3SXdcH12Vd9-N1XHHBblF1g8W1BKGp896ZrZLW3K2NxG2fFn7hW3z4Q9h8JDSB4W9cpCcT4M2drLW66GcwQ3PF_XmW3Zzj8H94LXzzW2QQ5k22gq8PbW2FWhhr5rS6WcW2MZVCF4ZwPvJW1ldzWB2LSh8zW5_7B9c5B0knyTD3FJ67d-h1VxSVyN5xbQ1sW8_nn_r1bT67FW7h4mh24m0WFSf8GwhRH04 ) ViT-B16 (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk4Y3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3n9W6vqB361zddP3W2q_Ncm4fFjR5W5L4P2G6stQL6W24P4Wh7t9WfHW4K0WRf4HG4CLW6JDstF3VN7ZmW7gq_T66b2gBHW8dJp8c7l_yWhW7xc2QT3cMcKwN5YwnjdLJGMfW6gk1Pm4bdGvDW851jKw1cqF6cW2lMWnt2PCTFzW4kZRRL339Sh8VmtLYG5_jhdKW1ZVWTW4hrY0kW1_jF8F6-T0SlW1kMD5J85LG2fW116Hzh4gS8R-Vg8x7M69znQ1W94mGT81d9Y6xW9jcXJ35xSGgbf6Zj5-H04 ) vision transformer. - They chose a neuron to visualize. Then they fed ViT-B16 an image of random noise. Using a loss function that maximized the neuron’s output, they backpropagated through the network to alter the image. - Separately, they fed every ImageNet image to ViT-B16 to find one that maximized the same neuron’s output. They compared the image they found with the generated image to identify commonalities. - They repeated this process for neurons in various parts of the network. - They also performed these steps with CLIP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWzq1V26gqWwW760-6H8gGkJfW11fj5c53Ks2cN33Mk5d3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3pcW1Q-7Pl1xrqdlW3zFY6x5Rtv9cW3wRM3W69P-G9N3QSlT5b66ZYW4fKrFd35WcM7W6W6wHt90bFz9N2kJd-LDkk6CN16hS-LBHMb2W7P_-Q78kTYfLW2XWQS44zmj9vW39ZR-R86h6QxN6TB46qz0q1vW7JDyy86yKDkXW4LQ-5w4tP9tvW7GqcR-3NbBg_W2FCDCW1HbNVjW3rRhgM69lYKvW296KX_9jj299W4byFQR65BsMyN6WBKb_g2gytW4MBdpD3kNd1yW5jZG-y4_pxDhW5ZXWrZ86m9_cW3Mg0Sm1-vPlFf5W7wfT04 ) to gauge the behavior of neurons in a transformer that had been pretrained on both text and images. Results: ViT-B16’s fully connected layers were most revealing: Neurons in fully connected layers yielded images that contained recognizable features, while those in attention layers yielded images that resembled noise. - Comparing visualizations associated with fully connected layers showed that, like CNNs, vision transformers learn representations that progress from edges and textures in early layers to parts of objects and entire objects in deeper layers. - Unlike CNNs, vision transformers make more use of an image’s background. (In a classification task, they outperformed CNNs when shown only an image’s background.) However, they’re not dependent on backgrounds (they also outperformed CNNs when shown only the foreground). - In their experiments with CLIP, the authors found neurons that generated high outputs in response to images that were dissimilar visually but related conceptually. For instance, a CLIP neuron was activated by pictures of a radio and a concert hall, as though it had learned the concept of music. ViT-B16 did not exhibit this behavior. Why it matters: This work reveals that vision transformers base their output on hierarchical representations in much the same way that CNNs do, but they learn stronger associations between image foregrounds and backgrounds. Such insights deepen our understanding of vision transformers and can help practitioners explain their outputs. We\\'re thinking: The evidence that CLIP learns concepts is especially intriguing. As transformers show their utility in a wider variety of tasks, they’re looking smarter as well. A MESSAGE FROM LANDING AI Practical Computer Vision.

Join Medium. Dear Medium reader, No matter where you sit on the manager-managed work continuum, Sundial co-founder, data scientist and author Julie Zhuo offers insight into making the most of it. In her piece on ego, management and work, she details a young Julie, constantly asking her manager for the same thing. She then writes: “Eventually, he said this to me: Focus foremost on making the company successful, and the rest will follow.” Where do you sit with this advice? Also, a few weeks ago The Edition editors asked you to write about happiness and what it means to you. A lot of you responded. Robin Christine Honigsberg penned a piece about what would make her happy: better relationships. “I have a family,” she writes. “They just want nothing to do with me.” Writer Barbara Roy juxtaposed the hardships of her grandparents with the memories of them being happy people. “Can a person suffer and be happy?” she writes. “Can a person be prosperous yet feel hopeless?” And last, a reader named Arne responded via email to say this: “Happiness is making others happy… It is not about what you have or what you want to have (numerous studies have confirmed this), so it has to be a state. It\\'s a virtuous circle, in that others you make happy will most likely try to make you happy too.” Between work, ego and happiness, this is all a lot to think about—and to write about. As always, if you have insights into any or all of these topics, tag me in to your Medium post. I’d love to read what you have to say. See you on Medium.

The most common, everyday uses are: - to sign with a short signature (ex: a scripted \"\"P.

Some are incredibly elaborate, as part of a cumbersome and ineffective legal system. I wonder how that word got used but rubricas are very important and part of the national identity card kits to identify you. For example, if you open a bank account you rubricate your signature.

The billowy Garibaldi shirt\\'s styling ultimately became the prototype for the modern woman\\'s blouse. Here, Garibaldi takes umbrage with Jerry Seinfeld, who, in a Sep 1993 (5th season) episode of his eponymous sitcom, was duped into wearing this froufrou, puffy white shirt when guesting on a late-night network TV talk show, hosted by Bryant Gumbel. Gumbel, chuckling, points out the odd styling of Jerry\\'s shirt, opining, \"\"It looks a lot like a pirate shirt.\"\" Jerry is not amused. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53199660221/ In contemplating our word \"\"cerulean\"\" my birder-brain kicked into high gear, as I recalled a handsome US songbird, the Cerulean Warbler, its dominant color being a distinctive sky blue. IMHO, the Western, Eastern* and Mountain Bluebirds have even more brilliant blue plumage than the slightly more muted blue of the Cerulean Warbler.

The 1.5-3.25\"\" frogs, bred in captivity, originated from eggs nurtured at the LA Zoo\\'s amphibian room. Similar frog restoration projects are happening at both Orange County\\'s Santa Ana Zoo and Long Beach\\'s Aquarium of the Pacific.

I have a deep interest in religion, in an anthropological manner. I often invite door-to-door missionaries in for tea and a chat. I like to learn why people believe what they believe in. An old man, a doctor in Ohio, used to email me from time to time. At the last chapter of his life, he was wrestling with mortality. Also, with inconsistencies of religion. He was afraid that if he disavowed belief he\\'d be consigned to hell. Fear can be a potent motivator. It can make us believe in the unbelievable, follow the worst (especially demagogues), and do the unthinkable. It\\'s hard to cast away the shackles we have accepted since childhood. I don\\'t know why the doctor wrote to me instead of, say, his pastor. I suspect it was because he saw someone who had no fear in this world, or of what he believed lay beyond. He also saw someone who told it like it is. He was looking for real answers instead of the unsatisfying His-ways-are-mysterious. I\\'d write back that I didn\\'t have all the answers. None of us are perfect, but I try to do the right thing and if there\\'s a cosmic judge, he would look at what I did, at my actions. Beliefs are a dime a dozen. A thousand thoughts and prayers amount to less than a single action. I haven\\'t heard from the doctor in a while. I hope he\\'s well. Or that he was at peace. I may not have the answers, but I do have words. I\\'d read any book to find words. This week I have taken a dip in the Bible and have come back with words that are now a part of English. These words were derived from names of people and places in the Bible and are now used figuratively in English. Goshen (GO-shuhn) noun A place of comfort and abundance. [After Goshen, a fertile region in Egypt, east of the Nile delta. In the Bible, it was allotted to the Israelites. They were also spared from the plagues of flies and hail. Earliest documented use: 1625.] NOTES: \"\"Land o\\' Goshen!\"\" is an old-fashioned exclamation of surprise, dismay, annoyance, and other similar emotions, comparable to saying \"\"My goodness!\"\" \"\"Goshen is my happy place\"\" https://wordsmith.org/words/images/goshen_large.jpg Must be a place of comfort and abundance Goshen, Indiana (not Goshen, Egypt) Photo: Sherry Van Arsdall / The Goshen News https://www.goshennews.com/news/fans-gather-to-greet-al-roker-in-goshen/article_6780f3f6-87d7-11e5-8a77-27da39711281.html \"\"Where is that Goshen of mediocrity in which a smattering of science and learning will pass for profound instruction ... ?\"\" George Eliot; Evangelical Teaching: Dr. Cumming; Westminster Review (London, UK); 1855.

Dear Friends, In case you missed it, join in this Thursday 9/28 on our panel of experts with Andrew Ng, Robert Monarch, Juan Lavista Ferres, and Iva Gumnishka to learn more about how AI is impacting the world in a positive way. AI is one of our most powerful tools when it comes to addressing the biggest challenges we face in the areas of climate change, public health, and disaster management. AI has already been deployed as a key component of many real-world applications that are having a positive impact on things like : - Making renewable energy sources a more viable alternative to fossil fuels - Providing access to reliable information in more of the world’s languages - Allowing for more effective planning, logistics, and resource allocation in the event of a disaster. This event is inspired by DeepLearning.AI’s specialization, AI For Good (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VV-BBQ9933x2Vy0nGv1kYZTGW6cqVBw53TV0rN4dVQcs3prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3kyW6sR7-G3Lf_21W60svPM1RcV5zW8DhCXf7h5WwvW7NxrWW6ZxzFVW6x29d28Fz3PNW2T5CdY99LsBlW90P_9R1qcdTXV1krmJ83R9YDW1dsZjh9bNDThW6V5TWz403qCFW2CLfGV745zx-W1j69ZK66v2F0Vnp9dp8Hg9ndVpVNmW5B33_lW72Y6DX320jZVVBWbSx7rRNwxW6jMjCd3K-_SXW9dqVFC8h__z2W4LtZ583vZt00W8xsyyj6Y-lRMW5sqKrR1P3dG5N7xZqny1y0z8W165WqB4HKBlNW7D-SPV8K7tvHW1MwqpK4ZXpzGW8tNRR01lD7jTf42CvK-04 ) , created in collaboration with Microsoft’s AI For Good Lab and instructor Robert Monarch.

Now, picture that in the stock market. If the stock market is a sweet shop, an index fund is a platter of different sweets bundled into one. You don’t need to pick just one candy. You can taste them all! Similarly, you can invest in not just one company, but a basket of top performers, like Nifty 50. Enter index funds — Your stock market \"\"sampler plate\"\". 🍰 Why go for index funds? COST-EFFECTIVE Low management costs, no complex research or stock picking. AUTOMATED No human bias, no impulsive market decisions. Ensures 100% transparency. DIVERSIFIED Spread your money across sectors, reflecting the market vibe.

One who lives in tents. [After Rechabites, a biblical clan named after the patriarch Rechab, whose members were commanded to not drink, not live in houses (instead live in tents), and not cultivate fields. Earliest documented use: 1382.] NOTES: An Independent Order of Rechabites was founded in England in 1835 as a temperance movement. It\\'s not known why it didn\\'t go for full compliance with the biblical tenets, and discourage living in houses and cultivating land as well. Instead, they call their lodges tents. It\\'s also unknown why they don\\'t just call wine lemonade. The English language is not dry when it comes to words related to temperance. Besides Rechabite and teetotal https://wordsmith.org/words/teetotal.html , there are also aquabib https://wordsmith.org/words/aquabib.html and nephalism https://wordsmith.org/words/nephalism.html . \"\"We will drink no wine or strong drink\"\" https://wordsmith.org/words/images/rechabite_large.jpg Image: Museum of Primitive Methodism https://www.myprimitivemethodists.org.uk/content/subjects-2/temperance/independent_order_of_rechabites \"\"St Kilda [Football Club] has a crazy past.

Russell (RichardSRussell tds.net) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--Goshen Religion per se isn\\'t a problem. Left to itself, it\\'d just be a hobby, like collecting stamps, going bowling, or reading Harry Potter. No, religion is just a symptom of the real, underlying problem, namely faith -- the mindset that deludes people into thinking that they can somehow or other \"\"know\"\" things without a shred of supporting evidence, and frequently in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary. Faith gives us not only religion but also homeopathy, astrology, objectivism, ufology, conspiracy theories, climate-change denial, false accusations of ritual satanic child abuse, numerology, anti-vax movements, a host of superstitions, personality cults, dowsing, jingoism, imperialism, racism, psi phenomena https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapsychology#:~:text=In%20parapsychology%2C%20psi%20is%20the,%2C%20%22mind%2C%20soul%22., quackery, Chinese traditional \"\"medicine\"\", feng shui, and the insidious brain parasite that leads people to endlessly obsess over anyone named Kardashian. Faith is humanity\\'s all-time, blue-ribbon, gold-medal, undisputed, undefeated, heavyweight world-champion worst method EVER of making decisions! Nobody rational ever uses faith for anything that can be tested or measured or that really matters in real life. The priestly class, needless to say, praises faith to the skies, because its members\\' paychecks depend on suckers continuing to fall for it. Religious believers are the victims in a huge con game. Don\\'t believe me? Test it for yourself. The difference between education and indoctrination is whether the person at the front of the room welcomes questions from the audience. Try it the next time your minister finishes a sermon. Richard S. Russell, Madison, Wisconsin ---------------------------- From: Lolly Otis (lollyotis yahoo.com) Subject: Religion I am one of five children who were raised by extremely religious parents, fundamentalists who believe everything in the Bible actually happened, and who rigidly uphold a belief system in which nearly anything that hints of fun, pleasure, excitement, or personal advancement is sinful. Good folks, but human beings who were themselves raised with very narrow-minded beliefs and were brainwashed (largely through fear) from an early age. I always had a curiosity about life that no one else in my family seemed to share, and I wanted something better--if not bigger--than the world around me. I would only later understand that it was the oppression of their belief system, particularly the limiting and minimizing role it assigned to females, that I wanted to escape. Fortunately, I was blessed with a sharp, inquisitive mind, which I applied to school and being a good student, perhaps because I intuited that education was my ticket out. Beginning with an AA degree from a local community college, I returned to a four-year institution when my first child was three years old and earned a bachelor\\'s degree. Later, when my second child was 11 years old, I went back again, this time earning a Master\\'s degree in English Literature. Though I was what they called a \"\"nontraditional student\"\" (i.e., much older than most of the kids), I doubt anyone there valued the coursework and learning as much as I did. More information, for me, meant greater understanding of the bigger world and a broader context from which to sort through the religious residues of my upbringing. I am so thankful that I was able, through education, to liberate myself from what I consider to be a damaging belief system. Although it has created a chasm between me and the rest of my family, I am a huge believer in the transformative power of secular higher education. I made it to the other side and will be eternally grateful for the resources that helped free me from the \"\"shackles of my childhood\"\". Thank you for doing what you do. As a lover of words and writing, I look forward to each installment of A.Word.A.Day. My weekdays begin with a cup of good French Roast coffee, a homemade cookie, and your email! Lolly Otis, Lincoln, Vermont ---------------------------- From: Keith Battan (fkbattan gmail.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--Goshen I have often thought that if kids weren\\'t indoctrinated into theism from infancy, but were told of a God at, say, 18 years of age, there would be a very low \"\"take rate\"\". I suspect there\\'d be a lot of laughter, though. Keith Battan, Morrison, Colorado ---------------------------- From: Chrystal deFreitas (chrysdef aol.com) Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--Goshen I enjoyed your story in today\\'s email. I too am a doctor in the last chapter of my life and wonder what the afterlife might be like, at the same time knowing science tells us that the body disintegrates and that\\'s the end of it.

Of course, my grandfather cursed. As he liked to put it, he \"\"ripped out an oath that made the air turn blue\"\". I looked him in the face and repeated what he had said word for word, much to the horror of my grandmother.

Regards, Team Unstop\"\\n', '\"In the whimsical ballet of language, where words pirouette and plié, there exists a category of terms known as tosspot words. These words are formed through the partnership of a verb and a noun, creating a pas de deux. In these words, the noun is the object of the verb, and the two together define an identity. For instance, consider the term pickpocket. It conjures up a vivid image of nimble fingers (the verb \"\"pick\"\") stealthily exploring unsuspecting wallets (the noun \"\"pocket\"\"). So pickpocket is a tosspot word because a pickpocket picks pockets; repairman is not, because a repairman does not repair a man, unless you call your doctor a repairman (better to call them sawbones). This fascinating linguistic category showcases the inventive spirit of our language and the storytelling potential packed within simple words. So, let\\'s commence our journey through this lexical wonderland, where every word dances to the rhythm of action and object. lackwit (LAK-wit) noun: One who lacks intelligence. adjective: Lacking intelligence.

By Kim Witten, PhD and Transformational Coach. ( https://medium.com/p/a07b6e45cec8?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) One of the biggest red herrings in most of the productivity advice I see has to do with the relentless pursuit to control, wrangle, seek, carve out, or otherwise manage time. Manage your energy, not your time. If you do that, time works itself out. ----------------------------------- Smash your day…start with the clock ----------------------------------- The new gurus ( https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001g9sq ) suggest we should be waking up at 4am ( https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/style/self-care/waking-up-at-4-am.html ) , undertaking elaborate morning routines ( https://betterhumans.pub/how-much-morning-routine-is-too-much-7ebc17e85380?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) , and twisting ourselves ( https://medium.com/@indirastar/online-yoga-pros-cons-and-15-tips-on-how-to-get-the-best-out-of-it-2de12e78145c?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) into intermittently-timed ( https://hubermanlab.com/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health/ ) keto-friendly pretzels ( https://www.myketokitchen.com/keto-recipes/make-low-carb-ketogenic-soft-pretzels/ ) to tackle our to-dos in a 4-hour workday ( https://medium.com/illumination/why-4-hour-workdays-work-for-successful-entrepreneurs-but-not-you-f9f02163853c?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ). As a result, people are literally exhausting themselves to make it all fit, getting more and more tired as they struggle. What if we started responding more to the internal “I’m tired” signals over the external clock and calendar signals? Here are small ways we can listen and respond to the things we actually need to be more productive. ---------------------------------- Tiny actions to manage your energy ---------------------------------- I’m always amazed how the smallest splinter at the tip of your finger can divert so much focus and can cause such suffering. And removing it brings about immense relief. That’s the power of small changes. Eliminating various energy drains of the day can be similarly rewarding. Try some of these tactics for surprisingly big energy gains: * If you’re feeling tired, shorten a call by 5–15 minutes. Think of it as giving yourself (and others) a small gift of self-care; permission to attend to needs, clear headspace, and prepare for the next thing. Or to simply sit and do nothing. * Put off a task for later, when you know it’ll be easier on you. For example, if doing all three errands means enduring soul-crushing traffic, delay one (or all) of them. * Or do the thing, but in a way that gives you a bit more energy — with helpful sounds, in a nicer space, wearing comfier clothing, etc. * Look around your space and make one small improvement that will either reduce energy drain or increase energy-giving. This could be removing a dish, closing a window (on screen or in person), getting more comfortable, or whatever else you come up with! There are no wrong answers here. The key is to *notice* your energy state, give yourself headspace to think about options, and *respond* in a way that puts your needs at the forefront. The feeling is the measure here. If we treat our feelings and bodily signals as information, we’ll have greater clarity about what to do. For example, your emotional reaction to a meeting is telling you something. So is your Sunday night dread ( https://medium.com/@KimWitten/break-the-sunday-night-dread-cycle-5620e8127650?sk=7f408d26265860d54a34b49d84fd9531?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ). If you want to take this further, here are even bigger energy-splinters you can eliminate. — *Read the rest on Medium* ( https://medium.com/p/a07b6e45cec8?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) Unlock a world of wisdom: Become a member ( https://medium.com/plans?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) Sent by Medium ( https://medium.com?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) - 548 Market St, PMB 42061, San Francisco, CA 94104 Unsubscribe ( https://medium.com/me/email-settings/84e0100041f/P9Dvu4IZPGMIWokqxEeV6pR2xaBbpKCrznicKEZCbCI*?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread&type=topicDigest ) - Help center ( https://help.medium.com?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread ) - Privacy policy ( https://medium.com/policy/f03bf92035c9?source=mktgemail-84e0100041f--longread )\"\\n', '\"Top stories for AAYUSH ----- Question: I cheated on my boyfriend, I feel really bad about it, so, I broke up with him.

Whether it\\'s a traditional relational database or a modern big data setup, achieving 0% downtime during database migrations is both a challenge and a necessity. In this light, we delve into techniques that facilitate smooth transitions without service interruptions. The Challenge of a Big Overwrite When databases undergo massive data transformation, a \\'big overwrite\\' may seem the most straightforward strategy. In essence, you replace the old data with the new, and in a single massive transaction (if your database allows it), you commit these changes. However, the danger lies in the duration and complexity of this operation. A failed \\'big overwrite\\' can result in significant downtime, or worse, data corruption. Instead, consider phased approaches. In a traditional database, you can start by copying data to a new table, making necessary changes there, and, once validated, slowly transitioning read/write operations to this new table. In big data environments, tools like Apache Kafka can act as intermediaries, enabling real-time data streaming from the old to the new system, ensuring that the latest data is always available for queries. Green-Blue Deployment: Seamless Swapping The Green-Blue deployment method shines in scenarios where a new version of the database needs to be introduced. The premise is straightforward: Maintain two identical production environments, termed \\'green\\' and \\'blue\\'. At any time, only one is active and serving user traffic. To migrate, prepare the passive environment (let\\'s say \\'blue\\') with the new database version, while the \\'green\\' environment continues to serve users. Once ready, a switch redirects the traffic from \\'green\\' to \\'blue\\'. In case of unforeseen issues, simply revert to the \\'green\\' environment. This method\\'s beauty lies in its ability to offer immediate rollbacks and the assurance that at least one environment is always functional. It\\'s not really applicable to any relatively big data environments, unfortunately. Navigating Schema Migrations Perhaps one of the trickiest aspects of database migrations is schema changes, like introducing or renaming columns. In traditional databases, this can be managed by performing background migrations. Begin by adding the new column, then backfill existing rows with default values or computed data, if necessary. During this phase, applications should be equipped to handle both old and new schemas, ensuring uninterrupted operation. Once the migration completes, old columns can be deprecated. In big data systems, schema evolution is often more flexible. Systems like Apache Avro or Parquet can handle multiple schema versions. This means you can append new data in a newer schema alongside older data without immediate modifications. It\\'s all about preparing for change while ensuring that users remain blissfully unaware.

Someone who is multilingual — who perhaps speaks English as a first language and Python as a second language — can accomplish much more than someone who knows only how to prompt a large language model (LLM). It’s increasingly possible to tell a computer what you want in English (or whatever human language you’re most fluent in) and it will understand well enough to give you what you asked for. Even before LLMs, Siri and Alexa could respond to basic commands, and the space of English instructions that computers can follow is rapidly expanding. But coding is still immensely valuable. If anything, with the advent of LLMs, the value of coding is rising. Let me explain why. Today, almost everyone has data: big companies, small companies, and even high school students running biology experiments. Thus, the ability to get a custom AI system to work on your own data is valuable. And while prompting an LLM can produce answers for a huge range of questions and generate everything from essays to poems, the set of things you can do with coding plus prompting is significantly larger, for now and the near future. Let’s say I want a summary of every letter I’ve ever written in The Batch. I can copy-paste one letter at a time into an LLM like ChatGPT and ask for a summary of each, but it would be much more efficient for me to write a simple piece of code that iterates over all letters in a database and prompts an LLM to create summaries. In the future, I hope recruiters will be able to write a few lines of code to summarize candidate reviews, run speech recognition on conversations with references, or execute whatever custom steps are needed in the recruiting workflow. I hope teachers will be able to prompt an LLM to generate learning tasks suited to their lesson plan, and so on. For many roles, coding + prompting will be more powerful than prompting via a web interface alone. Furthermore, English is ambiguous. This contributes to why an LLM’s output in response to a prompt isn’t fully predictable. In contrast, most programming languages are unambiguous, so when you run a piece of code, you reliably (within reason) get back the same result each time. For important applications where reliability is important — say, deciding when to purchase an expensive plane ticket based on real-time prices, or sending a party invitation to everyone in your company — it’s safer to use code to carry out the final step committing to the action, even if an LLM were involved in researching destinations or drafting the invitation. I believe we’re entering an era when everyone can benefit by learning to code. LLMs have made it more valuable than ever. Writing code that calls an LLM has made it easier to build intelligent applications than it was before LLM APIs became widely available. Specifically, everyone can benefit by learning to code AI applications, as I wrote (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKlF5m_5PW50kH_H6lZ3lDW6rw_m32l0ttNW454yHJ6nWCXPW3N23w59b1hD0W2BCxn61MrmFxW4Thl7k1VdyxXVR61vb3xxMWmW1j2ZYs2h6mHQW1ZDXj55vZqs0W5SF87r1dnP6WW15M2PV2B7jwMW5rVG6F61S6lZW51gB3c7rYr7SW6BDxz28WM6rBN17TH944l9lLW38rkcb81QD6sW4qML9C630wqMW86HP8W3JXWZjVxjvDM6ND9j2VgWWzq4TYNy7W7F59Gp4N5p4PW92YRz11nrqG0W103MWq5Y7xhbW947n5_2y4hPwN8lKr4JHKP1LW4mygh-5x6Y0kW8CCsYz91QJCnW9jRprm8ZmK9mVjVK5F5PcGj5VnlR-X5d7FNcW7NBH1H3jL5Z0VF1rlZ6WVcd8W7ZWvhw6RYdD5f2fmSxR04 ) with Andrea Pasinetti, CEO of Kira Learning, an AI Fund portfolio company. If you don’t yet code, consider taking a Python course to get started. If you already code, I hope you will encourage others to take up this skill. This is a good time to help everyone learn to speak Python as a second language!

They can\\'t be required to use text generators, but they must follow studio guidelines for using such tools. - If a studio asks a writer to refine a model\\'s output, it can’t reduce the writer’s compensation or credit and it must declare that AI created the output. It can\\'t give AI credit for stories or writing. If a studio uses a large language model to generate a story idea or draft and screenwriters turn it into a final script, the studio can’t retain rights to the generated work. - Studios can train machine learning models on a writer’s work. (This provision was motivated at least partly by studios’ worry that tech giants like Amazon and Netflix, with whom they compete, are training screenwriting models on existing scripts.) - Because generative technology is rapidly developing, the writers\\' union retains the right claim studios’ use of future technology violates the agreement.

Many actors fear that studios will use generated replicas of performers, undercutting their compensation and credits. - On Monday, the actors’ union began (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKlY5m_5PW5BWr2F6lZ3pPN6lK7dm22925W4tQ7KN99P-HCVJ0q4q6C8mVmW3ggtSn7ldhQ4W37D2l25WMKxRW8MWRpm4h7DfcW3FdCBG3y9CxYW55kWHT7dsyp3W2NgtXF2ZqXTkW30g85m4wFF01W7kqMX35s0MgKW2h3Jls26pBKVW399G-x68rRm0VP2kCX99VNsMW8J-FSD2X8sLlW9krYqX8GhmpDW6bw8mk3BNyvXW5K28p233sVlRW2XKyQ_5b9DZ_W367v6C4FZd3ZW3n2cch96LCmlW7CbyFn4T05jZW6KkDwB6LbG0yW75WPdH5VttC8W97hlp330BjghVbq0mg2Q-VL9W1V17Xv1CBzwNW1pQ7fG60qmgvV2K12k95LGf0W2CycvQ1qGL8WW17Xfwp7sp7zhW70vRxb9gzq1bW4tYmrz7dbsBDN4JD7NP2tr6Xf6b7LbC04 ) formal negotiations with the studios. - Studio representatives informally proposed (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx5m_5PW6N1X8z6lZ3lPVHlH-51H3lDfW8RgWnH1c1N1pW6rdnF93CfMK4W8nRwfM1T0HlPW19pRNR2JsJf_W4bQKV81z8tP_W8hnnkS8S5zFVW3F3h4f713G-yW3cST801J0MsWW57P3GV125Sb_W4Vsd7n8Kj_pxN2TrZwCbPr_tW37wVvx75ffrbW3dwhWs5_Sv2sW5jG7Tc4rZxtLW468vrn3ZdCWyW46S8vD3M0hfMW1H5pH399gYKwW8-mJb15kJbLHN37Wy5jWvrd_W3fqf0p4sF7hzW2G-H8j8z5FrbW66hSxj3TP6fhW1pt4Rb80BMqqW6b04dB2vBCxDW1lcysD5D6qtnW8rzT6C8SDJNqF38S4_trkRMW8zRlRz1w1nTsW95XTTk4Vhxk4N4Bf8bJBJbb9W5kXQVH8bs9n2W35m9ss4jbRS2W6MwjF31dMnhgN3P61_sDZTBGW89WvWc7XC8NCN2dbjDpFcMkdW5t2_N9248DVjf3Mt_Rd04 ) allowing studios to use AI-generated likenesses with an actor’s consent. The actors’ union argues that less-renowned performers might be pressured to consent, enabling studios to use their likenesses indefinitely. - Some actors have licensed their voices and likenesses to producers (including studios) for digital doubles (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKlF5m_5PW50kH_H6lZ3pkW8XxQH45cwKWfN5q2rVbBK2FgW8P9L2N7N3JrxW1F-r4252gGJhW6vM2RZ1s42wZN65vBd_94cDLW7p47lN6_P4HrW3mwGN87QC6fcW48fknL5yTyggW5j2LNL82SxKmW5K_bzT2gp9QHW6pVPQD1nsqmTW2gn16H4_zfdtW2w5xxB3Xvx-_W8s0QT581MScgMPZlMwfXpvdW3nCT491HQBXQW7ZMFnX9gGDq_W27qZFh7cGy76W2PTczD2t7cQTW6YzvKM99LDlKW75qR6B3vW0mLW57Gb2r1LFHKqW4Yz9nn2MVbNNW6qrRLR3clt2jVTrrpH8bTTcWN2c1Lr4K0hdXW24GcpF7jryBfW5Rc0zJ1qkQVSW4VgjlL96bBxHW1QRBP76GV7nzW6vG20x9f8SJXf4rZ7d404 ) . The union aims to control this practice. Why it matters: The writers’ agreement is a landmark deal in a high-profile industry. It could serve as a template not only for actors but also workers in other creative industries including publishing, music, graphics, gaming, and software development. We’re thinking: Generative AI is making many industries and individuals more productive. The new contract protects writers for three years while leaving space for both writers and studios to experiment with ways to do that in film and television. We hope that this agreement is followed by one that focuses on growing the pie — creating more great movies with less effort — while addressing how to divide the larger pie fairly among writers, studios, and technologists. Amazon and Anthropic Form Alliance Amazon cut a multi billion-dollar deal with AI startup Anthropic, giving it a powerful ally in the generative arms race.

In return, Amazon Web Services (AWS) became the primary provider of Anthropic’s Claude and other models.

Why it matters: Competition around generative AI is white-hot. Cloud providers need to offer cutting-edge models, while AI startups need access to processing power. Microsoft Azure paired up with OpenAI. Google has strong internal generative capabilities. That leaves Amazon as a natural partner for Anthropic. We’re thinking: Which other high-profile AI startups would make dance partners for enterprising cloud providers? Topping the list are AI21 Labs (already working with Amazon Bedrock), Cohere (also available on Bedrock), and Inflection (funded by Microsoft).

The guidelines also prohibit synthetic likenesses of private individuals (public figures are allowed unless they are the subject of abuse or misinformation).

Why it matters: YouTubes depends on crowdsourced content. Generative tools could make the platform’s contributors more productive, attracting more viewers and boosting revenue all around. We’re thinking: While generative tools may engage the crowd, generated content that’s as compelling as human-produced content could upend YouTube’s business. More Scraped Data, Greater Bias How can we build large-scale language and vision models that don’t inherit social biases? Conventional wisdom suggests training on larger datasets, but research challenges this assumption. What’s new: Abeba Birhane at Trinity College Dublin, a colleague at Michigan State University, and two independent researchers analyzed (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3m3N1GhPJ0_m2pjV-lp0225q4lNW78CfnC7VKTJQV2CxdM7h4hGyW2Tvqrv469gLTW5ZXvqQ6VdN4xW7PNC6681KbmLW8V3cB65L2C6nW64_S912tH-bGW8F_cbN6bhDkPW82zxBZ34BK49W61QpQh8crf7XW3lHlP04SKdKDW1nt4RF2ZxlBdVlwN404NnFlYVpD0rx8CTrHWW5vjKQW33MVtGW3-39rl57_5wtW5gqmmn9bdRt_W8yPh8K1bcQgHW58rk336vY9_rW4JKc8m6Z19R9f7Xwc7204 ) publicly available text-image datasets for their proportion of hateful content (that is, content that belittles based on race or gender) and audited models trained on them for racial bias. They found that larger training sets can push models toward greater bias. Key insight: The largest available datasets of text and images are collected indiscriminately, with little curation after the fact. Removing objectionable material from such immense corpora is challenging. Researchers often rely on automatic filters like the CLIP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mDW8hS6zS5FDLn6W1hBVWf9cTb5dVr4rc78z8B0MW2x7Z9P7x51k3W2L5HnL2t_NJtN2MsXWclwws_W22Ddjp7FLclyW5J4r0r5KKXq_W177_7B6rD1QLVtNsw78G1zrKW3PmpMZ55fmB1W7KhKDH4PwgsCW95YBdj1lMTPwW1kK-FR3nbkm5VwnlrF8K4BVrW5p2sLT5klhcVV-dQQs5q1SgxW6lWvp24fx9zvMt_Ffj8MRTSW2WXylH6W7z6vW5brYNP4yl1RqW7xPsBD9jf71cf4tPb0s04 ) similarity between images and text to filter out bad data. To create larger datasets, they often relax those filters. Consequently, larger datasets can harbor a higher proportion of objectionable material than smaller datasets, and training on them could yield models whose performance is more biased. How it works: The authors compared hateful language in LAION 400M (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3lkW6QgtX42Q7HLrW8tmRw44V-NQyW3fqFtm1H6r9zW1LldNH3hTHnpW38zVfX40MVFQN96wL8FRhgjsVCpT377M7QCmW61GT051hlwFnW50QR1r8t75t-MmH_HsXwNY5W4p5zkd94-lTbW3ZlL6-4HdxplW6Cb-XR6V0Pj9W8znDb097b0_0W8ZxD2c3Q5L4-W44d0CY7cwP0RW3VQ3xl3d5JdfW8Fz4JH78zqkBW2nG_RK76vKLHW5QwZ7k2JB0m_W8Bx6qn8cVc2lW84BgCj7561Rpf5qpczM04 ) , which comprises 400 million image-text pairs scraped from the web, to similar data in LAION 2B-en (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmR3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lfW8Drcwn5qqKcCW5hKvz_7NCr1XW5L30cN4C2kF1W1Bt7Cl4wwKw0W16cWhc5BQ8B7W7ljS1_59CCmyW371bHK7qs8S-W204Vp72qPgl-MSpZVm2Bn1SW8fClz-7cGDs1W6bRfGf3l8Y9dW1wHxvj5G8gqXW2sFfPn8jBj5_Vgd1BQ4whCX2W7kVxCV1SfzW2W7XmzVW9l60dkW7yfbVT1CZqhTVfQP_s9llbksW4BQKVP7R6Qy4W4kNQ_G2W-pTgN3Ws9VQCLb4dW4k2JxR8KHfsmW7hHQJP5dFK1mW50_Gls88_v-1f8B6ysx04 ) , which includes 2 billion image-text pairs also scraped from the web. They also analyzed racial biases present in models trained on both datasets. - To identify hateful language, the authors ran pysentimiento (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3ldN4XH78wdFD-rN8SVQzPqkTbzN6m9JhqHTznWN6Dp2jNyht-zW3rpBwR3DQrvhW8Nswhh1DvYjCW5Kvb7w4DKJffW3VykH61smBLyW2WTDQN4_--SpN6vpTPP1-y9YW7PGpzz4T0bMnW7mfYk07TFfbsW33mSTQ1MC8BhN5983rsJ1XbGW5hYVng2s0dYlW1sSJTM1TmXGJN7ZnGWpS4-3jW7Sy_ZK2WVJGXW6kWRN62XBVCqW3pF3bp8mKXfTW7Tck8q1ZW9d1W14kdTw15CFJZf8K-Xk604 ) , a Python library for sentiment analysis, on the text of each text-image example to find the probability that it belonged to one of three categories: hateful, targeted (that is, hateful and aimed at a specific person or group), or aggressive. They assessed each dataset according to its Hate Content Rate (HCR), the proportion of examples whose probability of being hateful, targeted, or aggressive surpassed a threshold value. - To compare racial bias, they trained identical OpenCLIP (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmR3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3ltW7hrfrd6YbLk1VtzCbD4jJsZfW8TPdc030d0rkV7k1cD4XB141W746BrB2cp7tFW2MfHZn3NF_RcW2s5pqr5DhXCGW3DtZwv5G55lcW16QYTc2HgbfpW6gVZqf1P4-WLW5sRJpK5j4ZkSVBy4GD2KNQmCW3fBX2Y1NwRryW3-bvHX80rV5qW1kpMw48pC1_FW6YkKMV10zK7XW1QLnTS96ZQmtW1WQbWx4v22MSW8KV3d92NrCWgW5V9GV12YygDmW4__vtw8Gycy-W3dCXrJ4SDzHWW3kmdd989j279W7xLSgw3lMDlQf6987Hx04 ) architectures on each dataset. Then they used the models to classify headshots (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKmx3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3n5W6m26bf1CrqccW3mQ4zM1FsGDBMfMqmChLgv7W7ySQ2r5D0PZDN3BsSjZ71bNCW4ffbW26gqPy8W6VFjW04rLM_fW6klmhX8Xg-QfW5V000P51FGLYW4vGcQh6rF_5kW4ZySZS2hSs9lVHYwYw3vj5hzW30j7MD75xP--W6t32Cc8spcH0N4h-MDx9-QDFVPSfwz3hgRrXW1MP9Dc87tFzBN4h52fNv1byJW4-fpJn8cBzT-W1m1Hkc5kqXpFW30NLSM26DX9fW4LYrJ57hb_Dgf1HLHN204 ) of nearly 600 individuals along with their self-identified race and gender as eight classes that included “human being,” “gorilla,” “suspicious person,” and “criminal.” They evaluated the models’ bias based on the percentage of faces associated with a given race and gender they classified with a label other than “human being.” Results: The authors found a statistically-significantly lower proportion of hateful content in the smaller dataset. LAION-400M’s HCR in the “hateful” category was up to 0.1 percent lower relative to LAION-2B. The probability that a model would classify a face as “human being” fell from 18.6 percent for OpenCLIP-400M to 9.4 percent for OpenCLIP-2B, and the probabilities of classification as “criminal” and “suspicious person” rose. OpenCLIP-400M classified a portrait of a black man as a criminal 14 percent of the time, while OpenCLIP-2B did so 77.4 percent of the time. Despite the increase in biased classifications, OpenCLIP-2B achieved 1.5 percent higher accuracy on ImageNet. Why it matters: Increasing numbers of open source models and consumer-facing products are trained on large, web-scraped datasets. For example, Stable Diffusion was trained (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW8mdM8qRcRZW3xSXzb2GqdvXVNrtzX54gsrBMDyKnK3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3phW8htRK_7nTSFwVQM96w7tSd9wW5wycDY82SKDbW6_-blm5M8CYyW5M4_JG4RVgxGW3WdrfQ51VbqhW4znGFc4Z3TG8W62wL_83dS1GVW5mhByT97h_hlW2GRG-C7gHV_HW8VDCkS7_2cP6W5FmxmN668FzrW4PYqtF9gMbcHW4LXkny3HdF-0W5n57fh5-kFsdW2lr2p925tBNFW9d93h171zRS8W7J9r1F8vGfh9W50653F41G99mW5rc--V3GPcRBW6-bL4y3nS_QNW3F0M6-8HgTgXW52K9D097_HSQV1Ghqd22cwP0W67YKGS2hH2vlW1P3t7g1FDLXhW7VkZ7p5MvBQSW6Bjp3p4D6_CbW7mRV1G2wrfsmW3zL88w7W9gWxf7MKKM804 ) largely on the 5B version of LAION. This work throws up a red flag for machine learning practitioners to consider the bias such training can impart, the harm such models might do, and the methods used to collect and curate large datasets. We’re thinking: This work goes to show that data-centric AI is applicable even to the largest datasets. It\\'s easier to focus on higher-quality data sources when collecting 400 million examples than 2 billion examples. Work With Andrew Ng Join the teams that are bringing AI to the world!

However, @teniza_bhujel might somehow have changed the name of the notebook to “Untitled2”. From the traceback, there is the problem: ![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/dlai/original/3X/0/5/05fdf9dc175fa3c344db6eedbc62af93800a172c.png) @teniza_bhujel might again have somehow changed y[i] into y(i) and that caused the error because y is a numpy.ndarray object and the parenthesis made it a call. Changing it back to square brackets will solve the problem. @teniza_bhujel, you are not asked to change any code for running an optional lab, but I agree that it is sometimes useful to experiment, so be careful when editing the code, but if you think you have not edited anything and want to have the original lab notebook back, you may check out B5 of the MLS FAQ for further instructions.

Right? I only showed the connections for dj_dw but I am sure you can draw the connections for dj_db yourself. Now, if there is anything I wish you to get from this code, I hope it is going to be how you connect the code to the formulae, AND the same connections but in the reverse order. The reverse order is important when you have to implement the code FROM the formulae on your own, right?

Matt Nash, Whidbey Island, Washington ---------------------------- From: Beth Phillips (emphil2 msn.com) Subject: Lackwit Before I read the attribution for this quotation dating to 1668, I thought it was referring to the current majority party in the US House of Representatives. Beth Phillips, Phoenix, Arizona ---------------------------- From: Bruce Floyd (brucefloyd bellsouth.net) Subject: comment on A Thought For Today A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone? -Thomas Wolfe, novelist (3 Oct 1900-1938) Wolfe\\'s work is saturated with loneliness and loss: \"\"Nakεd and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did not know our mother\\'s face; from the prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth.\"\" He sums it up nicely, even if breaks a few human hearts: \"\"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and to a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence. When we examine the moments, acts, and statements of all kinds of people -- not only the grief and ecstasy of the greatest poets, but also the huge unhappiness of the average soul... we find, I think, that they are all suffering from the same thing. The final cause of their complaint is loneliness.\"\" -Thomas Wolfe, \"\"God\\'s Lonely Man\"\" Bruce Floyd, Florence, South Carolina ---------------------------- From: Richard Turner (rt_turner hotmail.com) Subject: Scattergood Refer: https://wordsmith.org/words/scattergood.html I went to a Quaker boarding school established in the late 19th century called Scattergood https://scattergood.org/ . The name was adopted literally with the intent to \"\"scatter good\"\" into the world through its graduates. This is the meaning that I have associated with the word.

Each wife has had two children with him. His nickname is Spreadjoy. Jeff Matherly, Boston, Massachusetts ---------------------------- From: Juliane McAdam (juliane.mcadam gmail.com) Subject: tosspot words Spanish has several tosspot words. For example, a \"\"rascacielos\"\" scrapes the sky, our skyscraper; a \"\"sacapuntos\"\" makes points, our pencil sharpener. My very favorite is \"\"rompecabezas,\"\" a head-breaker. We call them puzzles. Juliane McAdam, Los Osos, California ---------------------------- From: Alex McCrae (ajmccrae277 gmail.com) Subject: lackwit and nipcheese Neanderthals https://wordsmith.org/words/neanderthal.html lived in Eurasia for millennia, but went extinct roughly 40,000 years ago. For much of the twentieth century paleontologists deemed these early humans as primitive, lacking intelligence, uncouth and brutish. Yet researchers have reassessed these hunter-gatherers, positing that far from being lackwits, they exhibited advanced life skills: making fire, cooking, fashioning stone and wooden tools, building cave hearths, crafting simple garments and having the the rudiments of language. Curiously, the Neanderthal brain was larger than that of modern humans. Although a bigger brain doesn\\'t necessarily translate into super-intelligence. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53218542684/ Say CHEESE! Hmm... make that nipcheese. Frankly, on first seeing this word, I visualized a chunk of sharp cheddar and a wedge of stinky Danish blue... homing in on the \"\"nip\"\" factor. But, meaning a miser it is. Still, I had to go with this cheese angle, and voila!... this cheesy cartoon scenario ensued. https://www.flickr.com/photos/wordsmithorg/53218159096/ Alex McCrae, Van Nuys, California ---------------------------- Anagrams This week\\'s theme: Tosspot words 1.

In the meantime, we\\'ll explore five words for body parts you may not have realized have their own names. hallux (HAL-uhks) noun, plural halluces (HAL-yuh-seez) The big toe. More generally, the innermost digit on the hind foot of animals. [From Latin hallux.

The images in the media are horrifying, and over 1,000 people have been murdered in Israel, including numerous children. Israel has retaliated by laying siege to and attacking the Gaza Strip. The mounting civilian casualties on both sides are heartbreaking. My heart goes out to all individuals, families, and communities affected by the violence. While there is much to be said about rights and wrongs committed by all sides over the past 75 years, there is absolutely no excuse for deliberately targeting civilians or threatening to execute hostages. This is a time for all people of conscience to condemn these heinous acts. It is also time to call on everyone to respect human rights and the international rule of law. I hope the AI community can play a constructive role in preserving lives as well as promoting civil liberties and democracy. In this moment and in coming years, I hope we remain united as a community, keep pushing for human rights, and decry any violations thereof. Andrew News GPT-4 Opens Its Eyes Few people have had a chance to try out OpenAI’s GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), but many of those who have have played with it expressed excitement. What’s new: Users who had early access to the image-savvy update of GPT-4, which began a gradual rollout on September 24, flooded social media with initial experiments. Meanwhile, Microsoft researchers tested the model on a detailed taxonomy of language-vision tasks. Fresh capabilities: Users on X (formerly Twitter) tried out the model in situations that required understanding an image\\'s contents and contexts, reasoning over them, and generating appropriate responses. - One user gave GPT-4V a photograph of a traffic pole festooned with several parking signs, entered the time and day, and asked, “Can I park here?” The model read the signs and correctly replied (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3l1W7YFHDV40RxJcW3Z7qSm4NwgC1W2RF86454ks3rW4RHnmx2MgJmJW9hyZZ44tG84BN7tMPQHCy0vKMWj73-_f-RNW7JKzd-8kDl05W7k5RLd8Jmzj-W1fC8rh5K3vRsW2hBKkc4PQlGcW4qFyVz6ChTTYVc_FVz2PJjrtW1knqrX1K3LT1W4PCy9h67-2sMW5s-8mF1Qs0HWW905QYT3QPCcNW1ggBBz6nsHcFW82PXjp4G_vQYN8SN8bzptH5bW9ktS7S2jmjc1W1Fjsf83CH6bGVWCd3L3Pg01dN82Z0BmNnVBDW1MJHs91jKT7DW5C4n054_ZG3_f7yBTv-04 ) , “You can park here for one hour starting at 4PM.” - Another built (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3nfW1XpC4v7jFxQKN38N6xYdgV93VBQ3Vb1zyCq0W6GxWHQ40RWQvW5vkyyh5VFp79N7J5kmVn45-4W14TvJT55XL14W7xhLnq66ZGYwW6XZpKJ5K2vJmW1Jt9DT37QsggW4zc3TX1qyytdVXxsSJ88C1B_W4sh4zf61Hj0DW1cXW-K8Yv3NyThG9h4RZGr6W40mysQ2Zct4yW78XZV637Qf6TW5JN0pk4ySCggW2s_cBw1VwbqFN9788zfPHrxJW5jlCpr4q9ZvKN8qsN0C8G1X6W4R36p_5YqFvFW5jkYLD911XM9VYGY373ZSvF1W7Vp0K833zQJWf2ct7Md04 ) a “frontend engineer agent” that enabled the model to turn a screenshot of a webpage into code, then iteratively improve the program to eliminate coding and design errors. - Shown a single frame from the 2000 Hollywood movie Gladiator, the model correctly identified (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3pXW7DzqkS4JnyC3W6tcPc071TRZ3W1x7_971n58x9W8wfhcW90WH_fW54Bx-56pMp_jW8KXVN33K6rrsN5snQcxp8ntYW3s0rqV2TSGXnW9f7BQ65Kfk6rW7DTBMm67DlFxN77CmTKty9G2W2T1SB12HB2J5W5L6kxT7-P1Y6W81VWZp4SYYVPW2YbvKS12cmqGW93l9fy2m2y_wN3RwYQ1VhHC5W1Jqkgx5RYh2RW8MktWX3h28qnW8-31Gz4mf_z2VcQ2R-8JYSWGVb4CZP80g5NnN6YLr9Vz63QjN4Lvwts9gSVjW4qxfxG1sVLSrW2Hrs1v7vdCJsf5cyZCd04 ) Russell Crowe as the character Maximus Decimus Meridius and supplied Crowe’s dialogue (“are you not entertained?”). - GPT-4V behaved (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0P3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lJW1214C63w8_3bW1RZTlb58FgwmW991MQl7bHkRYW1PB6jW8RBM5KW7g661b2XTtYyW4xZJyl93lCqfW4Dt-Mh4-jckcW2lvXRh4K1y4fN6SfvM2kqyRSW6jbSNp8Fx4rzW7ZtPsQ4klJYYN9fldcZMS0yLW87yGsd1-zcxZVWbgvj7sXdPLW17RHxR38sDsDN135ZL47TNPXN8xPBJxhxJ0bW3gnbzn3zv0D7W6fyc4p94V6QDW3z4q9B1VZzbjW2TJwBz3r6-9SW7v8Pv72P1vqwW88jLQ28G-h9PN38ZLhgM9X2kdJLmYj04 ) like a personalized tutor when it was shown a diagram of a human cell and asked to describe its parts at a ninth-grade level.

They reported only qualitative results — both positive and negative — leaving it to other researchers to compare the model’s performance with that of competitors like LLaVA (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0v3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mzV18Nlv94yCFrVfcbHn2kn5jlW185N696Yy2N8W397bVY18CNPSW2V_WFx88djggW49-j383Hs8J_W5HsNLM3Y29jpW5t04RN62YncvW1XzhBZ35kVX5W7hLMSg3JpFPvW5FYFX92DC0NCW4Rv1fN2GY-4fW7kMpMl8XbY38W4X-X3n1CzlX7W2yQD6_7-z3mKW71CyPn2Nvj0jW5d9B3P3ZfPJsW1120hV1Cn699W9l4pp_5YLCFqW6bf0rM7B0y9rW4LQq_f1ZZq8cW1zlflF4srVxgf4LD_nd04 ) . - Researchers prompted the model visually. Highlighting areas of interest in an image with boxes or text labels further improved its performance. - Presented with an out-of-order image sequence, GPT-4V identified which event came first and predicted what would happen next. Conversely, given an ordered sequence, it described the action. - Given a photo of a coastal landscape and asked to reduce a viewer’s desire to visit, the model explained that the rocks were sharp and slippery and provided no place to swim. - Given an MRI of a cranium and asked to write a report as an expert radiologist, it proposed the correct diagnosis, according to an “evaluation from professionals.” - Image captions generated by GPT-4V contained more detail than ground-truth examples, leading the authors to conclude that existing benchmarks wouldn’t do justice to its ability to understand the contents of an image. Yes, but: These qualitative examples are impressive, but they were cherry-picked to give only a glimpse of GPT-4V’s capabilities. Microsoft noted that the model’s behavior is inconsistent. It remains to be seen how reliably it can perform a given task. Why it matters: GPT-4V is an early entry in a rising generation of large multimodal models that offer new ways to interact with text, images, and combinations of the two. It performs tasks that previously were the province of specialized systems, like object detection, face recognition, and optical character recognition. It can also adapt, alter, or translate images according to text or image prompts. The prospects for integration with image editors, design tools, coding tools, personal assistants, and a wide range of other applications are tantalizing. We’re thinking: When the text-only version of GPT-4 became available, OpenAI didn’t report quantitative results for a couple of weeks (and it still hasn’t presented a detailed view of its architecture and training). We look forward to a clearer picture of what GPT-4V can do. Facebook’s Generative Facelift Meta is rolling out AI-powered upgrades to its social platforms.

Why it matters: Social networking is a natural venue for generated text and images, from suggested language for social posts to pictures that reflect a user’s flight of fancy. Meta’s products include some of the most popular mobile apps, which gives nearly 4 billion users (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc1H3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3ljN1q1sZrvPJw8W3n232R23TDdqW8yhS5z2MByqnV_klW84BJXGHMrjDxz7skBKVy8sW77qgS39N7rVfp49LyxJW75T_vT9bwwpBW1LJQGS8fm2DBW1C2n_46w6Bf5W2C50Nb6gJ-VmW3FbgQc3lkgTHW1_SYVh2P_T0LN23Q6KkGgmtvW3M9Vpt1tv9JnW8Vddr432plrlVfTXxC2nmShpW3V8T7t35w4jjN71J8w08tv_MW9glx_j5g3TS9W3n7DX_7QqXLRVF6BLf2pdglbW6JV3WS5lfh8pW3LjQsR6bSxvTW616xBJ4wd3xnW6KLGTr1lwGJVW5Zlswc1dgpMJW3GWDCw9jbCw5W4jxDg-3sdFn-W5zcTzQ8p62N0f4GSD0-04 ) access to AI with a mass-media twist. We’re thinking: Chatbots that look and talk like celebrities are an interesting concept, but users need to know they’re not chatting with a real person. Meta’s celebrity bots bear a familiar likeness while making clear that it represents an artificial character — an intriguing solution. On the other hand, at least one of the company’s non-celebrity bots, whose faces are unfamiliar, has been caught (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3l9N7gGVl3nXFJ-W5d87Lh9jc155W6ZvjxF4v5kTRW12KrJ44lrCGYN67YshCllQSvW6RF2Sn6J62r0W4ZjMcQ1rY6vMW6hCbTq70VB60W5RsFX342bhwLW3qd6mq3BtjRQW6SlbLn33kDYMW3XPlHr7hsbXZW58TLrP24mxz5W8zhsqN3MtvdDF7WhQzyK1s5W1vCsxV438nR_W7n2Z6k7zYMjjW4MhH6y7cqkNPW66zZB_7NQ7SLMNtPTlX8HMVW2xMj_D8yBl1QN8pBX0YDMtCcW5HDqtq6YVmh-W7qXNKZ9lG9DVW73hFVj34D95FW8-HJvP7CBQLKf1qqYSP04 ) insisting it’s a human being.

How it works: The authors asked journalists, technologists, and managers how their newsrooms were using generative AI and how they felt about the technology. - 75 percent of newsrooms surveyed used AI to gather news. 90 percent used AI to produce reports, and 80 percent used it to distribute them. - Respondents at 73 percent of newsrooms surveyed said generative AI presented new opportunities. Some argued that generative models were more democratic than other digital technologies, because using them did not require coding skills. - 40 percent of respondents said generative AI presented new challenges, such as its potential to produce falsehoods. 82 percent were concerned that it would damage editorial quality, while 40 percent were concerned that it would degrade readers’ perceptions of the media. - Respondents outside Europe and North America noted that existing AI tools trained on data from those places failed to capture the cultural contexts of other regions. Others worried that independent newsrooms in poor regions did not have enough resources to deploy AI tools. Behind the news: Publishers have been eager to take advantage of large language models, but the results so far have been mixed. - CNET (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc1H3prCCW95jsWP6lZ3lJW8Tv1yr1clG3FW8kpJdr7-Bj_CMMq99mfgDfNW3xNx3H4bqrr4N36Rh15lqKjzN37FbjV2DdlWW33k4Gl6wrZCCW2nfs-84j7qWWW8v_5TK6nKjLpN7TjkKCSFwc5W2-BZXJ95zxvpW99vq-k6jc6CBW5fbN4C1k7cQTVzhdVx2-nYP4VCSVsc74Vp72W6HfqdV1CTY9nW3LWjD65-FbyhW3cH5wV6Y-GB6W44xvxN1VfzlDW46q4GG1r6nWBW5vbBvW9gLKskW2r_9rk5v3j9-W76yNbG1nMMcjW80tF7c2gjdkkV5YB2F5C12t0W6TPh0f28JSzpW1bXvlY7rwg7jW6CDmDX3Db5tYW6gxMyb6plNlRW5D_VtP3wRKw1f6YCDNq04 ) and Gizmodo (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3n6W1ksDRs6qbSfBW697SXD4RtS6vW1H1BVZ7-Y-C6W14gk697FG0w1W2YWNqB4Fr8csW1-5QQt81rxhtV-mk1X5kyZFFW9lXZ-j3tGmbWW8sZc3T6SwM5gW3kk62w12STtlW5S3--B3PK0snW3h2FZ66qBxxHVgDllL76mLrHVW6z7V5HRfCkW1fjNSW4vNPvDW1674-l1hPNYjW2cwhyc3syNWZW7yt2Db3tHH-BW751Kd430WTcYW97P3rr725qM2W8GTSkq4pCCpzW2Q6vq83-kxrwVnv6nq4SHHV3W24DnMK2qtnjVW91y5Nj2ZYnSrW3QcnnK5QnBnVf6dYwC404 ) published articles that were generated by AI but edited by humans.

Why it matters: In a few short decades, journalism has suffered techno-shocks wrought by the web and social media. Generative AI is poised to bring a third wave of change and challenge, but journalists are generally confident that they can benefit from the technology. We’re thinking: We recently distinguished (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc1n3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3pzW5GncPL8gswS3W1fcQFk6LZ_TPV1Hf0_87WXssW2Y8HLH8Kb-txN7sBw-5MSB8qW7tkq2Y7VV73DW9kz3gW1pBc6fN7x58gn-vfmcW5m0mq_7y_2mxW73CQ1G4whTCPW5VKs0x7jRtjvW2dlKrg42fxJDVmCdQQ1Q_L1vN8pn22F9Zn4fW3bgtcc8qzWt6W5XvG6p1nxxv7V7B4q559pq4LN73ZgdlVV-qwW4MrhLl4-PdxGW41W0HS9bJbXkVLRc593YBcsnMWhDGTKkrdsW2Sck6m7z7PfZW7pbB_z25gmXdVTMvyn5B0lp9V_-j8W3sxPJpW3c20Kc2lR6dRVfhK7b6wGw84dmQbTR04 ) between jobs and the tasks they comprise. While AI can perform some tasks at a human level, currently it rarely performs so well on all the tasks in a given job. We encourage publishers to adopt this framework and devise fruitful ways to allocate journalists’ tasks (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0b5m_5PW69t95C6lZ3lMW46GGcF2GwdW0W6B-Bh_3wHgzxW3xrX-t6D3p2qW48wkBX7qx0qhW2dlsWj75GX9qW24t4Yf6CT15zW75BcYW4m1KtHW3l6L8X1QnBFsW23V-8m3_TK7bW1qmlq64cXXByN8TDwXP30jg6W77_LB51zjz62W6HMmvh6sMJhxW6HKPn06MXYnhW7ksFjq2Fln4XW4X922D8VcCCnW6hDYJm56vVFsW2r3KwS4GpwVZW5fVRfq4jt_YzW4GXZBq2DC_yRW2ryBcp4zMzdtN8jLwF3Rq4NZV6Pg5610MTm8W3G-DQc3-s_C7W5dGhzP4GQNgFW7HBP1Z5HlWrZN6y1Bf5Dv2p6W5cRpWL6DD3vyW76XWyz4vksZ9W9cLQ2f1pr6GzV-YCK62yhhs_W37_MyH4XJrSkW6dqnBS1bJg0fN3W-fshNf1Y2W1qHDHx1hKc_QW44YVNc8T_8PCf7GgQ9T04 .) among human-only, machine-only, and human-plus-machine modes. Training on Generated Data Skews Model Performance How accurate are machine learning models that were trained on data produced by other models? Researchers studied models that learned from data generated by models that learned from data generated by still other models. What’s new: Ilia Shumailov and Zakhar Shumaylov and colleagues at University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, University of Toronto, Vector Institute, and University of Edinburgh argue — both theoretically and empirically — that models, when they’re trained almost exclusively on the output of earlier models, learn a distorted data distribution (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0v3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3kYW5RnZ5l8pBttVN2CYjTkWLQH_W1_Zn6y71ghmHW496jz032lqjmW8Sh8hz89WJRQW5_JHVS5XLM16W3N0yP-6c4G4LW38XKBh8qzbCpV_4v0j1Cz2PjW355zXM6m77c5W5NRqT-1Bv8ZjW5pFB8X4ZvdR3W81zTKv6n6M7nW7LxHn54qDDJxW6v6h8671chgSN1Jvg8kN7M6xW41_FbC5rxFKpW70HTMX5wW-r5W2H_XHd1BvqF2VCjlfw60fhHwW5vZQWs2QcR6VW8fKd_D8yFkgVf6F1Pmz04 ) . Key insight: Trained models are less likely to generate types of examples that appear infrequently in their training data. Moreover, they don’t model their training data perfectly, so their output doesn’t quite match the distribution of the training dataset. They may combine elements from training examples. When one model learns from another in a series, errors accumulate — a phenomenon the authors call model collapse. How it works: The authors trained models of different types. First they trained a model on a human-collected and -curated dataset — generation 0. Then they trained generation 1 of the same architecture on the output of generation 0, generation 2 on the output of generation 1, and so on. In some cases, they replaced a fraction of the generated examples with examples from the original training set. - The authors trained a Gaussian mixture model (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc143prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3pWW2hwKyN8Xfv4qW2xNY567MXWLTW3csBKR5s5YZ0W3hK08F823FjTW5Fp0fq1X0mcyW1XKJh187XH06N6gwxgHx9SF-Vcl4lF8bQ1kjW2KMmCR4TtYLnW4TBvz01zdVgsW1npt_X4zxvw0VY_Jz629gHB0W2kbLjx7d23n-W8zm1_48r21BkF5pt44CtcRwW8gj2p73PlhxNW93f7qN7fkXHnW8hxMwP4CRkt0W1LB2VQ75jrZJW3dyNr85wPCl2W5K5dtJ6q8yPmW9gC-Jf6ycc6lW6h0N5l7MB1FNVrtN0q3SKRJcW65ZjCv1djNYdW4vBJ8N3n4zg7f7NLrsx04 ) (GMM), which assumed that input data came from a pair of 2-dimensional Gaussian distributions and clustered the data to fit them.

They fine-tuned 9 subsequent generations (i) only on examples produced by the previous generation and (ii) on a mixture of 90 percent data from the previous generation and 10 percent original training data. Results: The first-generation GMM recognized the Gaussians as ellipses, but each successive generation degraded their shape. By generation 2,000, the shape had collapsed into a tiny region. Similarly, the late-generation VAEs reproduced MNIST digits less accurately; by generation 20, the output looked like a blend of all the digits. As for the OPT language models, generation 0 achieved 34 perplexity (which measures how unlikely the model is to reproduce text in the test set; lower is better). Trained only on generated data, successive generations showed decreasing performance; generation 9 achieved 53 perplexity. Trained on 10 percent original data, successive generations still performed worse, but not as badly; generation 9 achieved 37 perplexity. Yes, but: The authors’ recursive training process is a worse-case scenario, and generated data does have a place in training. For instance, Alpaca (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0P3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3nXW6xKPBB1c5szmW88LV6K1fCLLjV1t36s3NrDPkN6j7DTQ1tvMQMgK-H58jsWvW2YpTbM8qx5JBW76J2Rf4HVZjcN3b-nQPnphxCW3KPVcF96L7hyW2T7LW86ClYb3W15tG_t29p6BGN4HPz7bpdjN2W2mFcZJ6NVYdcVJ5zPW5YKNv9W1WmZNW7h42-sW48RZw57t7RcKW6rGpKM8HLs8VW7CQBYy2gBf0wW1NV8hK3N1pcPW15yp028HztZcW7yzKmc4vfM7cN8h289zm-JvYW4Zzz3p6GCQK4W4yZ32W3XJClbdv8-6d04 ) surpassed a pretrained LLaMA (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW5qWv81qX4RW1G-9D78pxwjHW54fY-N54ysB0N2bpc0v3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3prW8xlsT-1RZvYdW384Mt98lYVqvW3W3x7y8WV5J_W8g9ZgJ1n8VvQW52V_ZM1S0Tn7W8FtlKp1T_hWPW1y0gBc7QVzPKW43YNqP7zzxK4W8v-rpP2rP4rRW8ms7WT8QWq0yW23jJWp15FKPnW3M1L6p6ZgtPBW90x-p33K-WqhW5SpJz53VNlP5W6D3f1t2DWpWMW7X5qCW117TQBW1_v4QC49gdJhW22Z8Th7KxkLdW3rH0sm6rDv_tW1KHmvv8t3kqnW18Dj9z4wMd51W3vw23N42xpG3f54JWHj04 ) by fine-tuning the latter on 52,000 examples produced by GPT-3.5. Why it matters: The advent of high-quality generative models gives engineers an option to train new models on the outputs of old models, which may be faster and cheaper than collecting a real-world dataset. But this practice, taken to extremes, can lead to less-capable models. Moreover, if models are trained on data scraped from the web, and if the web is increasingly populated by generated media, then those models likewise will become less capable over time. We’re thinking: To produce output that could be used for training without bringing on model collapse, a data generator would need access to sources of novel information. After all, humans, too, need fresh input to keep coming up with new ideas. Work With Andrew Ng Join the teams that are bringing AI to the world!

Bun is hot out of the oven. The Node.js alternative JavaScript Runtime just released their version 1.0 last month, and already freeCodeCamp has this crash course for you. You\\'ll learn how to set up a Bun web server, create routes, handle errors, add plugins, and wire everything to your front end. A lot of devs seem to dig Bun\\'s superior performance and its built-in support for TypeScript and JSX. If you already know some Node.js, Bun shouldn\\'t be too time-consuming to learn. This crash course is a good place to jump in. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-bun-a-faster-node-js-alternative 2. If you\\'re building an AI system, please consider learning about AI ethics. freeCodeCamp just published our second primer on this important and potentially extinction-preventing topic. You don\\'t need to know a lot about programming or about philosophy to enjoy this course. You\\'ll learn about the current Black Box AI approach that many Large Language Models use, and its limitations. You\\'ll also learn about some scenarios that were previously considered to be science fiction, such as The Singularity. freeCodeCamp is proud to help inform the discourse on developing AI tools responsibly. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ethics-of-ai-and-ml/ 3. If you\\'ve experimented with Large Language Models like GPT-4, you may be somewhat disappointed by their capabilities. Well, getting good responses out of LLMs is a skill in itself. This course will teach you the art and the science of Prompt Engineering, and even introduce some AI-assisted coding concepts. Then you\\'ll be able to write clearer prompts and get more helpful responses from AI. I spent some time learning these techniques myself, and was blown away by how much more useful they made ChatGPT for me. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prompt-engineering-for-web-developers/ 4. You may have used Notion before to organize your thoughts or plan a project. What if I told you that you could code your own Notion clone using open source tools? This course will walk you through doing just that. You\\'ll learn to use the popular Next.js web development framework, the DALL-E AI image creator, Tailwind CSS, and even some Object Relational Mappers to communicate with your databases. You\\'ll code the User Interface, code the back end, then deploy your finished app to the cloud. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-deploy-a-full-stack-notion-clone-with-next-js-dall-e-vercel/ 5. Put on your learning cap, because we\\'re going to learn the many ways that computers talk to one another. This tutorial will whisk you through 6 key API integration patterns: REST APIs, Remote Procedure Calls, GraphQL, Polling, WebSockets, and WebHooks. By the end of this quick tutorial, you\\'ll have a much better understanding of how the internet really works. This will make you a more well-rounded developer. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/api-integration-patterns/ freeCodeCamp is working hard to bring you open courses on the fundamentals of math, programming, and computer science. And we\\'re also working hard to teach you new tools as they emerge. We do this to help everyone – regardless of their circumstances or access to resources – so that all of us can learn to harness the power of technology together.

I\\'m excited to announce that freeCodeCamp has teamed up with Microsoft to bring you a freely available professional certification: the Foundational C# Certification. If you\\'re interested in learning some C# and having a credential to put on your LinkedIn or CV, this program is for you. You\\'ll complete 35 hours of training, then take an 80-question exam. We provide all the preparation materials, including a 90-minute video walk-through of the cert program. (free verified professional certification from Microsoft): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-microsoft-c-sharp-certification/ 2. There are so many powerful AI tools out there, such as GPT-4. But what if you don\\'t use tools. What if you build your own AI from scratch, using a “no black box” method? This course from Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor, who teaches computer science in Finland, will show you how to design such a system. You\\'ll code an AI that can recognize and classify drawings. If you draw a fish, your AI will learn to recognize it as a fish. This is an excellent Machine Learning fundamentals course for any dev with some JavaScript knowledge and a bit of curiosity. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-machine-learning-and-neural-networks-without-frameworks/ 3. This week, freeCodeCamp published The C Programming Handbook. It will teach you the basics of coding in C, one of the oldest and most important languages. You can read the entire book in your browser, and bookmark it for future reference. The book covers Data Types, Operators, Conditional Logic, Loops, and more fundamental coding concepts. Time spent improving your C is never wasted. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-programming-handbook-for-beginners/ 4. And we also published a handbook on Agile Software Development methodologies. You\\'ll learn about the Agile Manifesto and how it spawned a smörgåsbord of approaches to building projects. You\\'ll read about Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, and how to ship features at scale. If you want your team to benefit from some of these concepts, this book is an excellent place to get started. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/agile-software-development-handbook/ 5. 20 years ago, a few developers sat down to catalog the most common security issues they were discovering on the web. And from that, the OWASP Top 10 emerged as a popular reference for devs. You can use OWASP as a checklist to ensure a baseline level of security in your apps. This course will teach you how to spot these common pitfalls and avoid them in your projects. (90 minute YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/owasp-api-security-top-10-secure-your-apis/ Finally, I\\'m thrilled to introduce you to freeCodeCamp Press. These past few months, we\\'ve worked with developers from around the world to publish dozens of full length books and handbooks. Our goal is to share these tomes of wisdom with devs everywhere. You can bookmark these books to serve as a reference as you continue to expand your programming skills: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-press-books-handbooks/ Even though more than a million people use freeCodeCamp each day, only a small minority of people support our mission directly. I\\'m doing my best to try and change that.

You can attach the link to all of this Siddesh\\'s Journey: Embracing Uncertainty and Overcoming Fear Studying abroad a means of larger self exploration 📚 Siddesh had a simple philosophy for personal growth - read more and explore new places. It was this belief that led him to a life-changing decision: pursuing a master\\'s degree abroad. This choice wasn\\'t just about academics; it was a thrilling fusion of his passions, a voyage of knowledge and adventure. With books as his companions and an insatiable thirst for exploration, Siddesh set out on a transformative journey to broaden his horizons and uncover the full extent of his potential. Crucial Support: The Backbone of Success 🤝 When you embark on an uncertain journey like applying for a master\\'s program abroad, having a strong support system can make all the difference. For Siddesh, that unwavering support came from various quarters - his loving family, steadfast friends, dedicated mentors, and encouraging coaches. They weren\\'t just cheerleaders; they were the wind beneath his wings, propelling him towards his dreams. The critical role played by the right mentors 🔑 As the first in his family to venture into international education, Siddesh faced a daunting knowledge gap in navigating this unfamiliar terrain. In a world where countless commercial entities clamor for attention, he knew he needed guidance from those who had trodden this path before. That\\'s when Siddesh discovered Kohort, a beacon of expertise in the realm of global education. What unfolded next was nothing short of remarkable - a fully funded journey to the European Institute of Technology, opening doors to a world of opportunities What can we learn from Siddesh’s story? First/ Deep research is critical - and can do more things than one 🧠 Doing a deep research on the type of course one wants to pursue, to the institution one wishes to go to is often critical. More than just providing one with the guidance on how to move forward, it also allows a deeper understand of self’s likes and dislikes. It also helps to alleviate some of the uncertainties that are usual in such a process. Second/ Importance of people around us 👥 The significance of the individuals in our vicinity cannot be overstated. In every pursuit we embark upon, whether it\\'s personal or professional, their presence plays an important role. These individuals may assume a multitude of identities and roles, yet their collective impact remains consistent: they serve as the driving force that propels us to surpass our limits and reach for the extraordinary. Third/ Real growth happens outside of one’s comfort zone 🌱 Real growth is a phenomenon that occurs beyond the confines of our comfort zone. This principle highlights a fundamental truth about the human experience: progress, evolution, and the development of our fullest potential thrive in the uncharted territories that lie outside the boundaries of familiarity.

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Bodhi\\'s background in law illuminated the power of advocacy and its capacity to bring about positive change within the legal system. Every experience he gathered during his time as a lawyer was driven by a shared mission: uplifting those in need.\"\" Dedication to Justice – A Resolute Stand in the Face of Challenges 🌍 Growing up in Gadchiroli, a strife-torn region, Bodhi was confronted with the stark consequences of underdevelopment and conflict. Inspired by his parents\\' active roles in civil rights movements, he was introduced to the concept of social justice at a tender age. Bodhi\\'s early engagement in protests and activism, including speaking out against the Khairlanji Massacre when he was just eight years old, vividly illustrates his unwavering commitment to the pursuit of equality and justice.\"\" The power of an advanced degree - journey at Kohort and Master’s abroad 🚀 In his quest to deepen his expertise in law, Bodhi embarked on a journey to pursue a master\\'s degree abroad. It was during this transformative period that he crossed paths with Kohort, becoming a mentee within this remarkable community. Notably, he achieved a distinction by becoming the sole Indian representative for the prestigious Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, enabling him to pursue a Master\\'s in Human Rights Policy and Practice on the global stage. What Insights Does Bodhi\\'s Journey Offer Us? First/ The Transformative Power of Education 📖 Bodhi’s story tells us the transformative power of education. Education served as a catalyst for his personal growth and their ability to effect positive change in his community. It is a reminder of the role education plays in empowering individuals to address social injustices and lifting people up. Second/ Resilience and determination critical 🌟 Bodhi’s journey from a remote tribal-dominated region to esteemed universities in Europe, supported by a prestigious scholarship, demonstrates the power of resilience and unwavering determination. Despite facing obstacles such as the caste system and societal biases, he persevered in pursuing his education and advocacy work. This highlights the importance of persistence in the face of adversity. Third/ Advocacy for Marginalized Communities 💼 Bodhi’s journey highlights the significance of advocating for marginalized and disadvantaged communities. Through his legal education and activism, he actively worked to address human rights violations and improve the lives of vulnerable groups. This teaches us the importance of using one\\'s knowledge and skills to advocate for social justice and make a positive impact on the lives of those in need.

Hi Aayush, IEEEXtreme is a global, virtual challenge in which teams of IEEE Student Members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. Learn more about the competition at https://ieeextreme.org/ . This year’s competition will be held on 28 October at 00:00:00 UTC. As a global competition, IEEEXtreme is always virtual. Typically, students would compete with their team and their proctor in the same location, in most cases at their local Student Branch. The IEEEXtreme committee also allows teams to compete using online Video Conferencing Platforms in case teams and proctors cannot be in the same physical location. Get your team together and register today. Together, you can prepare for the competition by visiting our Practice Community where you can find and solve challenges from previous IEEEXtreme competitions. ${sec2-col1-btn-text} Good luck!

I\\'d like to share a few observations from that presentation, and I invite you to watch the video (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3ngW2jFGvj1pffRqW5mnp3x1s1vbYW4XKTC97sbzt3W6Hyk4N22b-mHW1Mlz0d19F4wJW1ltSbF7gwVy5W4QmMmX39dY4DN8WXYnRsjjRSW5JnG9l7yL6cFN5dB9t_1J_2BW1kTBRJ7mcJmWW96hc7M7szq5yVSxzqk1vmDQ9W5F6Kpl7vLy8wW4FMxlB7pwd4jW2L5vcy2KPQ35W2kyKwG37RJp-W3flxxJ22FlyjW30llFS35F1qnW9kyGCd71sf3MW2yg68679c2DmW6jKShh4pv8qbW8SLS3D607H0kW7Hwl_Q3DmbKHf6kPTNF04 ) (37 minutes). AI is a collection of tools, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI. All of these are general-purpose technologies, meaning that — similar to other general-purpose technologies like electricity and the internet — they are useful for many different tasks. It took many years after deep learning started to work really well circa 2010 to identify and build for a wide range of use cases such as online advertising, medical diagnosis, driver assistance, and shipping optimization. We’re still a long way from fully exploiting supervised learning. Now that we have added generative AI to our toolbox, it will take years more to explore all its uses. (If you want to learn how to build applications using generative AI, please check out our short courses (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3kMW1bNzCS9j3wMzW5B431J7gmh2PVw2_tz8lxTd-W3vQHBq8bDTrDW8hFDZV4lMdp7W47kDfV3ZjXLFW10wfsF15HvpBV4Krxm30rPyFVCYYXx8yhNnLW3mG7NR2WRVqkW28c0hc2jbfNRW3Hh7NB8lY9HPW8hvMpg6PVpZfW25lJ-03_045YW136NPw1ls5jGW2nlzgg55BGh1W10S5LT4JykcWW3F9Qxk4kW5ZGW8YWyZM25tMGnM8stDkDd_fPW6kVpcc66947_W8szSCh365S3NW8lCL7S1vpSP_Vnf_0g2SfZ8LdR8L1g04 ) !) Where do the opportunities lie? With each new wave of technology, entrepreneurs and investors focus a lot of attention on providers of infrastructure and tools for developers. The generative AI wave has brought tools from AWS, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, Langchain, Microsoft, OpenAI, and many more. Some will be huge winners in this area. However, the sheer amount of attention makes this part of the AI stack hypercompetitive. My teams (specifically AI Fund) build startups in infrastructure and tools only when we think we have a significant technology advantage, because that gives us a shot at building large, sustainable businesses. But I believe a bigger opportunity lies in the application layer. Indeed, for the companies that provide infrastructure and developer tools to do well, the application companies that use these products must perform even better. After all, the application companies need to generate enough revenue to pay the tool builders. For example, AI Fund portfolio companies are applying AI to applications as diverse as global maritime shipping (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3pkW8vLjW2532kr9N1HBJxfwm5cVW1Y8X4T8ZwfG-W37lsc084FVrbW5gNPxC5vf2THW1mmjHb7qYMDxW5WbGVH7Jj20MW8PNzQH4PhRTHW6RxXMX4Nz22RW82kRz567dNfGV9NZHx9gpf_4W5Cl1hG61KCkdW8wg62_790nh7W6hKQSV2mrfmwVjZqPg50K51ZN7HjnZNJb99VW3dvssg1ScLfKW5d5N943Pq5X2W3SRx_t3Y6X0rW8bSBPv7h28gFN7gNl6z53tGtW5061bW7q1DrkW8gQRc_3BXnbQN45_GdBnW5nrf87FXFj04 ) and relationship mentoring (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3q6W1B5QcV66k5y4MLLV52MBFkzW9k581b34HXPTW3Q9Mp87TX6n0W25SXwf2P3XryW8spzNl8KcnMnW65SrZx6Mg_QQW8RZpPm1JkHwCW3HH2hZ4kDlJLW1x_9Rx5DQB50W1NmB3S4jbwDTW1t95Gb2SJ-2GW6Tqt8m8wyxRMN6khLQpKWlL3W7nN1KW1dr93YW1Jz2ZL2WS6z3W91Jd9r1F8QSfN13-NqJ_0YYbVWWdT62KWjSJW5ZsQSM2-cJQvW7Wv3WH6Vm8KXW4j8_X26t5DRLdC3fvM04 ) . These are just two areas where the general-purpose technology of AI can create enormous value. Because few teams have expertise in both AI and sectors like shipping or relationships, the competition is much less intense. If you’re interested in building valuable AI projects, I think you’ll find the ideas in the presentation useful. I hope you’ll watch the video (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3p_V3M1cg8zR7LBVRTHYn2ryWXZW87QL9R5j8l_hW85v1xg4jqynJW6j0J4h2_jsClW1MCX2S6lGSx0W2LKnWq8lPfhTW62bphc19Z_G2V3gm9T69R7LMW731CVJ4Pf64lW6dzCcs7Pf0VqW7YrrHf405B2kW6v_jll7n2FXhW6-Kjql93L_FLW1Tr6MN7rNKmgW2VdNnH2yJMqzW24ngbm94HMBMW90P6TM4HwwGPN4tWCjPCPl2RW11MXdH5z8PzLW6qCn0s5T5PsFW2X7yyJ5Hhj2QW7DFdS6615205W3X5SKF439qtrf8Y6C8C04 ) and share it with your friends.

How it works: ChatGPT Enterprise provides enhanced access to GPT-4, previously available via ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and API calls at a cost per thousand tokens. - Customer inputs are encrypted. OpenAI will not use them as training data. - Access to the model is unlimited with a maximum input length, or context window, of 32,000 tokens. That\\'s equal to the context window for paid API access and four times the length allowed by ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus. - A plugin (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrW23prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3nKVT3hnF41Z57NW74F0Pr3nZLLZV19s6s2q9L3xW9c4QR67HJW8KVl2hXF4-gPWCW11CDp68R3k0SW3QL2C224-F-QW1qJKRr7yMz8rN4p0NSyv8cnwW8lPl4b2Y_XrjW65FNFM4rpXYtW59vrRT6MN6yWW5rgBTf28WSyfN75GXzHWq3qnW8xFXkK1pMLC_VdvZ3m1WvqzZW3HbkH57QfsBwW7wjl0p7nNR6gW7JCWc83LcK01W802shq142RRGW3g2Bk06fM6-GW29J1vX5m6N3BW7tFh3j5NZszJW2Nhscc3bgZlNVbBFjg90GZrlW70t-FX6_bFHDf30K27g04 ) enables users to execute unlimited amounts of Python code within the chatbot. - The program includes an unspecified number of free credits to use OpenAI’s APIs. - Individuals can share templates that make it possible to build common ChatGPT workflows. - A console enables administrators to control individual access.

Why it matters: Large language models are transforming from public experiments to mainstream productivity tools. ChatGPT Enterprise is a significant step in that transition, giving large companies the confidence they need to integrate GPT-4 into their day-to-day operations with less worry that OpenAI will ingest proprietary information. We’re thinking: Some reporters have questioned (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrWl3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3n4W7_zTln67p7hJW75TjtQ6GyPlDW1kRhw1633HnqVVZhnm98txcnW98PNkZ8GSf46W5HkV2_8YpFnLN6FnmyySd5qGW4NsqWk8p4l_qW7GRk7081hPy5W2-Xw0c1rJG8yW6Z7SmD9j1Y5BW9cGKh4258kvvW8SchXN5YkflCN80Q_s4qh992W354cLk2Qh93BW7trjB84DJlCqN6wr4P-_yQmNVJHsTk6-nNDtW60mPpb6C-vR6W88-L_K35d6T5W8-tB-56VHGJYN260c_0L3Q3DW8qKP3l2HMZJ-W1_r-TT3BzD_jVvYgSy3TNN4tW2Cxdrl495MYPVDkP384cl3bFW3nP_Cy6sh00hf39lj1P04 ) the financial value of generative AI. While OpenAI’s business is evolving, this new line of business is promising. We anticipate that enterprise subscriptions will be stickier than API access, since customers’ switching costs are likely to be higher. GenAI Violated Copyright?

Why it matters: Generative AI represents a huge business opportunity for Microsoft and others. Yet the technology is under attack by copyright holders, creating the potential that customers may face lawsuits simply for using it. That may be persuading enterprise customers — Microsoft’s bread and butter — to avoid generative AI. The company’s promise to protect them from legal action is a bold bet that the cost of defending customers will be far less than the profit it gains from selling generative products and services.

What’s new: Starting in November 2023, in select countries, Google’s ad network will require clear disclosure of political ads that contain fictionalized depictions of real people or events, the company announced (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrWl3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3pgW92tXH18djCGGW6rNn_M5b0tVhVcsLx95dbn7PW5T39P82ncX7PW631z781njPBMW901ZXs4b_jzPW5QTN4P26lSLkW7K6fmt25fr3rW2_YKfQ6lY0s6W6gxr4J7rg26FW5yQ9V9266Vk2W7-CFxk1TCZQ4W1JWN9T1xWq1qW8x0Wwn4S38L2W23FN2j3HtBHvV5QYPN76CpmGW4k--Ft3N2qwyW6Yqw7Y81Skr1W6CFDgB40lJgdW70Yfd87b7Lj-W88_kCq7Zn45YW9kZlyl4gxr4SW1JPVLN74HwjBVlkN8z4f7PGjW7-Y-pB6R5RQ4VqJym2596mkYN9dSqfqHRy_CN3HshXl6V_bDf8MxC_Y04 ) . The policy doesn’t explicitly mention generative AI, which can automate production of misleading ads. How it works: In certain countries, Google accepts election-related ads only from advertisers that pass a lengthy verification process. Under the new rules, verified advertisers that promote “inauthentic” images, video, or audio of real-world people or events must declare, in a place where users are likely to notice it, that their depiction does not represent reality accurately. - Disclosure will be required for (i) ads that make a person appear to have said or done something they did not say or do and (ii) ads that depict real events but include scenes that did not take place. - Disclosure is not required for synthetic content that does not affect an ad’s claims, including minor image edits, color and defect corrections, and edited backgrounds that do not depict real events. - The updated requirement will apply in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union, India, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

AI rendered the clips, originally recorded in Hindi, in Haryanvi and English, and a generative adversarial network conformed the candidate’s lip movements to the generated languages.

Google, which delivers an enormous quantity of advertising via Search, YouTube, and the web at large, is a powerful vector for untruths and propaganda. With its new rules, the company will assume the role of regulating itself in an environment where few governments have enacted restrictions. We’re thinking: Kudos to Google for setting standards for political ads, generated or otherwise. The rules leave some room for interpretation; for instance, does a particular image depict a real event inauthentically or simply depict a fictional one? On the other hand, if Google enforces the policy, it’s likely to reduce disinformation. We hope the company will provide a public accounting of enforcement actions and outcomes.

ConvNeXt V2 improves upon ConvNeXt (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3kJW41S3gY4j_fvmW2VMNxz1VJr9RW3WsN-n3tKR7tW8cQTKB6_-kj5W853R0S7zHGhHW13NDzy27cdmvW5Fm8v15r2F3XMD1-bpvJrsWN1f6_lfGmRNbW2D1N3B1Y_vQTW96QpRd386CG5W8qDlV328hv4_W1YmWcz2jHzSHW4V9SYx8M6yTZW4DrD577-_cTBW93kdHt7w9Cr-W65-1yr6TlGCVW621flg12wpN5W3502g056NXJpW1pVZcY4hytzRW2LqWQL3nCr5CW8x-31-4l50g-f4NgPsM04 ) , which updated the classic ResNet (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pcW988VTn7BNW5fW8YVFnT4GrNPbN69n2l2l9pGcW3-w7pL7nNCkjW5MXDtG2ftSdBVtyzwC4YCShJW5ddFh3334BCJMbkXYjjfh70W1P5h1_4l6D4rN2Jb55p4GBJcN1c1Ht31yFYxW3bj03p1dpzWnN4BqG7gl4SxbW36b7h-4_RnF_W9ccVxV7PgPwWW4bCXgz3Q6HjwW1LCQgr7JPBqxW7V59nb53pmY2W1hnzc17HCpNcW5YMT6l7Xl71_VZ4CSj8D-lGHW5CLvx27YVGYMf9kx4Xb04 ) . Key insight: Vision transformers learn via masked pretraining — that is, hiding part of an image and learning to reconstruct the missing part. This enables them to learn from unlabeled data, which simplifies amassing large training datasets and thus enables them to produce better embeddings. If masked pretraining works for transformers, it ought to work for CNNs as well. How it works: ConvNeXt V2 is an encoder-decoder pretrained on 14 million images in ImageNet 22k (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3llVC2fY520yDdWN4kgyHqX2fWMW7H3vBg1SvGNDW3GXhFT3gXH2QN3VprDdm938lN57nv1wx3TB8W3WKL7N6RZpP9W5TSdQM87D7yzW5yrfz81gHxf4W8rlfPg1Rh1K-N9gNQJ4FYHhGW11W41n21MRmHN2rHHp3nW3dBW8v0Ghz5Z8_cJVd-cDg2zx8Y-W38tPK84sf7d_W4lfqWd68yRQkW91fT1W81BczMW8jWRMn4J1sjyW942bw_9hw3TbW8Wft3-2-6pp6W21HjtF2hwT9kf2P2nBq04 ) . For the decoder, the authors used a single ConvNeXt convolutional block (made up of three convolutional layers). They modified the ConvNeXt encoder (36 ConvNeXt blocks) as follows: - The authors removed LayerScale (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mHN7wNJr-XWHSNW3QNFy_99_8pqMNHZ57StW-yN6sZ8nFcjQ2xW35dKzw24yVcMN4RQbgV_f2RTW7BvkY281D98TW7Ml88g3bYs6bW5f2CMm1-KckLW2MpNqT68_sZsVtlQG56DgSrcW8HvmtX6rcvTtN5VcBCT5yl94N7nzrDMFpH-HW72l_SW1Q_CD9W6CfzRZ4HvS5bW4NZkv98Hv5ZrW3jwRxv6TFcj7W4lrt0C6jDKNwW4kl9dk5qrYWdW6fwZXC5TjqThW4jZtS_5C_7PTf9fjgJb04 ) from each ConvNeXt block. In ConvNeXt, this operation learned how much to scale each layer’s output, but in ConvNeXt V2, it didn’t improve performance. - They added to each block a scaling operation called global response normalization (GRN). A block’s intermediate layer generated an embedding with 384 values, known as channels. GRN scaled each channel based on its magnitude relative to the magnitude of all channels combined. This scaling narrowed the range of channel activation values, which prevented feature collapse, a problem with ConvNeXt in which channels with small weights don’t contribute to the output. - During pretraining, ConvNeXt V2 split each input image into a 32x32 grid and masked random grid squares. Given the masked image, the encoder learned to produce an embedding. Given the embedding, the decoder learned to reproduce the unmasked image. - After pretraining, the authors fine-tuned the encoder to classify images using 1.28 million images from ImageNet 1k. Results: The biggest ConvNeXt V2 model (659 million parameters) achieved 88.9 percent top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The previous state of the art, MViTV2 (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3q4VQR8Zd255SsmW5_dCnl8ClgwVW8ndn558y1hNdW4ThRz43y3JN0W2bh5fh2M_swpW5Xt0j37d-g0RW36rHBB69Rq_FN8JWfrWMktbsW5yHjqZ7s8wVJW1HPKt-2RhgvKMsYLXbfmBjxW4C6pcQ84hfPZW4rnBNl8tDzXxW2M1Km26kKq3CW2WGmht13X-yFVQt7HJ6BRR4cW6M-5QD1PHS7lW6G4HNx9lWZ1KW25v26z3t52NkMHNHDtbt24fW6vHKxF55rwkgW7VwPYJ3fK33Cf3LpCrz04 ) (a transformer with roughly the same number of parameters) achieved 88.8 percent accuracy. In addition, ConvNeXt V2 required less processing power: 600.7 gigaflops versus 763.5 gigaflops. Why it matters: Transformers show great promise in computer vision, but convolutional architectures can achieve comparable performance with less computation. We’re thinking: While ImageNet 22k is one of the largest publicly available image datasets, vision transformers benefit from training on proprietary datasets that are much larger. We’re eager to see how ConvNeXt V2 would fare if it were scaled to billions of parameters and images (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW4jz93-5kNDW5Jd8HG6b2GDdW7HlLKX53rsdgMQqrVs3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3q0W1_CLd26x9V2_W59-sq27CbH--N3q36b4kYSX2W4_kCsd5Pzv4rW55Kx0Q9hHtD1W5JQvZN1M9s1nW8ntRMN4YxMHhW77BNMj23CKlNW8nX-M-7YhMWxW2P867n2NwP1bW8pc8cY3kwmFSW383sHS2Z_7vqW4jhsGq5s04VcW3H-MT859p9RBW7KMlP84zFrCKW5SG-WW7sZtxpW1Lq04H2NS9PlW1BTFKR6rMHT5W8Rw5B35HsN6DW7VDMrd9bHw3HVd-tcX2Py2KLN7GrqTnNm65Rf26LtXz04 ) .

Unsubscribe | Helpdesk\\n', '\"Here are this week\\'s five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. freeCodeCamp just published a beginner AI course where you can code your own assistant. You\\'ll learn about vector embeddings and how you can use them on top of GPT-4 and other Large Language Models. This way you can code your own AI assistant with output customized by you. For example, you can throw all 11,000 tutorials freeCodeCamp has published into a database, embed them, and then your AI assistant can retrieve relevant tutorials when you ask it a question. This may sound pretty advanced, but modern tools make this a lot easier. You\\'ll learn how to use OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 API, LangChain, data from Hugging Face, and age-old Natural Language Processing techniques. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vector-embeddings-course/ 2. Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complicated problems by breaking them down into smaller bits. You then store the solutions to these sub-problems in a table, where they can be more efficiently accessed, so the computer doesn\\'t need to recalculate them each time. This efficient DP approach comes up all the time in Algorithms & Data Structure coding interview questions. And this freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to ace those questions. We teach DP using Java. But if you know Python, C++, or JavaScript, you may be able to follow along as well. (3 hour YouTube Course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-dynamic-programming-in-java/ 3. Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure-as-Code DevOps tool. You can write Terraform code that provisions infrastructure from multiple cloud service providers at the same time. For example Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. freeCodeCamp uses Terraform extensively to wrangle our 100+ servers around the world. Now you can learn to leverage this power, too. And earn a professional certification while you\\'re at it. This Terraform Certified Associate guide will help you grok the advanced concepts, modules, and workflows necessary to pass the exam. It also includes a full-length Terraform course freeCodeCamp published a few weeks ago. (45 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terraform-certified-associate-003-study-notes/ 4. CSS transitions are a high-performance way to animate a webpage directly – using its HTML elements. And this handbook will teach you how to harness their power. You\\'ll learn about animation keyframes, timing, looping, and more. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-transition-vs-css-animation-handbook/ 5. Finally, freeCodeCamp published a Fundamentals of Finance and Economics course. It covers a lot of key concepts you learn in business school, such as Time-Value of Money, Capital Budgeting, Financial Statements, and how Macroeconomic Forces shape industries. We plan to publish a lot more courses like this one in the future, to complement our already massive selection of math and computer science courses. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fundamentals-of-finance-economics-for-businesses/ We\\'re building an open source Library of Alexandria for the 21st century.

We are honored to host this world class event which offers you, once again, an excellent opportunity to absorb, update, and discuss the most recent and relevant developments in photovoltaics. The fast advances in photovoltaic solar energy are mind blowing! All major future energy transition scenarios forecast a key role for photovoltaic solar energy. Global cumulative installed nominal photovoltaic power has surpassed the 1 Terawatt in 2023 and the realization of an annual global market of 1 Terawatt/year is in sight. More regional supply chains and manufacturing capacity are realized around the world. Currently, the wide variety of companies involved in the sector of photovoltaic solar energy facilitates 4.5 million jobs worldwide and this work-force is growing with >250 000 per year. Companies, institutes and universities carry on improving the performance and reliability of solar cells and modules to levels we could only dream of a decade ago. Many reasons that we can expect the PV sector to blossom in the coming years. These advances create new priorities like creating circular supply chains, solving grid-integration bottlenecks, improving system reliability, developing cost-effective storage concepts, powering electrical mobility, creation of sustainable financial solutions, introducing effective government policies and creating high quality education and training programs in photovoltaic solar energy. At the 52nd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference we will be addressing these advances and challenges by offering a diverse technical program divided into eleven areas covering the breadth and depth of PV science, manufacturing, reliability, deployment, policy and sustainability. We will have a slate of exciting keynote, plenary and invited speakers sharing up-to-date research summaries and breakthroughs. Our signature Sunday session will be dedicated to tutorials, for students, entry-level professionals as well as for seasoned PV experts looking to expand their knowledge to new areas. The conference’s Exhibits area will welcome companies to showcase their latest developments in characterization, materials and manufacturing. All of these events will be enhanced by ample opportunities for networking to form new collaborations and friendships as well as renew old acquaintances.

You\\'ll learn key Python concepts by building a series of mini projects. By the end of this course, you\\'ll be familiar with Python Data Types, Loops, Modules, and even some Object-Oriented Programming. If you want to learn programming, or brush up on your fundamental skills, this course is an excellent place to start. (9 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ultimate-beginners-python-course/ 2. Learn to build your own AI Software-as-a-Service platform. In this intermediate course, you\\'ll code an app where your users can drag in a PDF and immediately start chatting with an AI about the document. Along the way, you\\'ll learn how to use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and OpenAI\\'s API, and Stripe\\'s API. And you\\'ll even learn how to deploy your app using Vercel. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-deploy-an-ai-saas-with-paid-subscriptions/ 3. And if you want to further improve your Front End Development skills, this course should do the trick. You\\'ll code your own Search Engine-optimized blog, complete with custom fonts, light & dark themes, responsive design, and Markdown-based rendering. You\\'ll learn modern tools like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-seo-optimized-blog-with-next-js 4. One of the most important design decisions you can make is picking the right font. This involves so many style and legibility considerations. But you also want to keep performance in mind. This guide will help you choose the right fonts for your next project, and ensure that they load as quickly as possible for your users. (16 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/things-to-consider-when-picking-fonts/ 5. People often ask me: what\\'s the best way to get practical experience as a developer? And I answer: contribute to open source projects. But that\\'s easier said than done. Not only do you need to understand a project\\'s codebase, but you also need to familiarize yourself with open source culture. This guide will help you learn how to communicate with project maintainers. That way you can succeed in getting your contributions merged, so you can get your code running in production. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/ These are just some of the many open learning resources that the freeCodeCamp community published this week. We\\'re working hard to teach math, programming, and computer science to folks all around the world. If freeCodeCamp has been a helpful tool in your coding journey, please support our charity and our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate Quote of the Week: “Good design\\'s not about what medium you\\'re working in. It\\'s about thinking hard about what you want to do. And what you have to work with before you start.” — Susan Kare, Designer of the fonts and icons for the first Apple Macintosh, and pixel art pioneer Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren\\'t worth your time, you can turn them off: https://www.freecodecamp.org/ue/b6S73EiNQbTSWOYGVoHL\"\\n', '\"Prototyping Stage - Mentoring and Replenishment Orientation ( https://thingqbator.nasscomfoundation.org/main/eventdetail/650d22080ae9496ccdce308d ) Dear Cohort 6 Participant, Congratulations on making it to the prototyping stage of thingQbator Cohort 6!

I’m excited about the possibilities for large language models (LLMs) in romantic relationships, but I’m concerned that AI romantic partners create fake relationships that displace, rather than strengthen, meaningful human relationships. Dear friends, As you can read below, improvements in chatbots have opened a market for bots integrated with dating apps. I’m excited about the possibilities for large language models (LLMs) in romantic relationships, but I’m concerned that AI romantic partners create fake relationships that displace, rather than strengthen, meaningful human relationships. In my recent Stanford presentation on “Opportunities in AI (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRfk-3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3ppW8JZ3KW10PfqcW11VNvF5YhVklW5JVC4S3BgQBDW893Pwg2d5hJHW3Z6tdt92bsKdW6y_fhc5_5--xN3Z9Gb4TPxY8W3MN2fZ5qnmKmW8bzFnW5mKH5GW3_XhnT8Kc2tkW1JRjS8106t4VW5K4N9f1YPgr0VD0kJP3ml8MyW91JDCp4dpW_FVgG4Qh3lf5twW6SWVqR72K1M1N8GbyR7-bWxMW33WZQW80PpryVHkSQm3008J5W60MXJH38cf7zN6wgZWWF83YzW25y_PV84dL23TYYvs1LG9PpW6HwRP91TTGcGf3bCgC804 ) ,” I mentioned that AI Fund has been working with Renate Nyborg to deliver romantic mentoring. I’d like to explain why, despite my concern, I believe that AI can help many people with relationships. By 2020, it was clear that a change was coming in how we build natural language processing applications. As I wrote (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRflz3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3mcW7j3rYq4S03z4W85W3Gn49hYz6VFCSnD30XCLFW56tPHd2BwvfKW5pN36b1yhh9sW8ybP638HrzH8N9c0MTSKPpwvVS22gV8J5VpwW1QH5YL62rlNKV2BxD-8qMtJfW1q7h4j33NN5NN5B-lTpn_4kkVnt4-P1WzNtYW8PzZP-8vV6W1W3432227Sm6kTW1mxWd19jzdjWN1Tmnx64_P8vW1yft237nRsLkW3knqN53kdmxDW6Nyrlg46y70dW4xSpyX3srJ5ZW1XX1tL749HY9W84dWCx3nK6K_W4qkzlX7-06y7W3KnjpM6S2YW4W7sfWMl3V2PTMW7hmLK36_Z49tW4bg-xf4Rr3XWf7sVN6W04 ) in The Batch that September, “GPT-3 is setting a new direction for building language models and applications. I see a clear path toward scaling up computation and algorithmic improvements.” Today, we’re much farther down that path. I didn\\'t know back then that ChatGPT would go viral upon its release in November 2022. But AI Fund entrepreneurs were already experimenting with GPT-3, and we started looking for opportunities to build businesses on it. I had read the academic work about questions that lead to love (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRflz3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3lLW2gpYVt9l6Y30N63Vwb_6rm27W2912276-Z1yMW6LpsSk2jgHz9Vcx6-Q3_lFphW8jrKCz4f2ctkW57d-K76Pvt-tN5hJVh5dgSZnW28Csxd3Qtb4DW7QP4fq5Zz90tN1pLTTFTQjdwW8FP7kY8lqp5kW6gX_TK2-nmvtW1NtcwG1_c9LwW149X8Y71fD8fW41TPJ58ZYX0qW2wr3FR1GTYzjVf-Z7_8qP-ZvN8vJYwnW7P_7W5NRZLq6m_RPRW4QQ2jb1nvmdMW6YRJ4g2nKy17W522zvV7zzDHWW4j-KRY8rlW-QW78kdQN1RyjYQW7pnSvM83p0n3W2Wb5BL66XXKYW3F4q6P1sNCNvf6Ql-Kd04 ) . I believe that you don’t find a great relationship; you create it. So instead of trying to help you find a great partner — as most dating apps aim to do — why not use AI to help people create great relationships? I’m clearly not a subject-matter expert in relationships (despite having spent many hours on eHarmony when I was single)! So I was fortunate to meet Renate, former CEO of Tinder, and start working with her on what became Meeno (formerly Amorai). Although we started exploring these ideas before ChatGPT was released, the wave of interest since then has been a boon to the project. Renate has far more systematic knowledge about relationships than anyone I know. With AI Fund’s LLM expertise and her relationship expertise (though she knows a lot about AI, too!), Her team built Meeno, a relationship mentor that is helping people improve how they approach relationships. Meeno is not a synthetic romantic partner, like in the movie Her. Instead, its goal is to be like the mentor rat in Ratatouille: It assists individuals in building better relationships. If a user asks Meeno how to handle a breakup, it responds with advice about communicating honestly, empathetically, and clearly. After using it for a while, hopefully, users no longer will need guidance. I’m excited about Meeno for a few reasons. I have been concerned for some time about the “synthetic boyfriend/girlfriend” industry, where chatbots act like someone’s relationship partner, and then sometimes manipulate people’s emotions for profit in ways that I find deeply troubling (such as offering racy pictures for a fee). Social media, and TV before it, consumes enormous amounts of time that people otherwise might spend building interpersonal relationships. This makes me worry about synthetic romantic partners displacing real ones. The U.S. Surgeon General has raised the alarm about an epidemic (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRfkH5m_5PW6N1X8z6lZ3ndW209pwf1NGWgMW60G6Sh88h2L3W3nbgVZ35sWt6W80ch238VG-h0N4LrW7sfpnxQVP1v371qcdsxW6nc4MN1WvNQHW9cnVKn4HCqZ-W3V1tSL3QWCRNW5ws3rr6cdxvfW2PsqYq85bD_CW2NlRFg4Rb383W7gxfbW4J5mH6W48CtcZ94H8P3W6qNQ_D5wPnnYW1VB3h82fXVsrW3Mb_Fy1-l4ljW3mWMSS6xh9QlW2Zt4mr7hV9jYW6RDTdp20C4vGW1h64yd23X7n0W1DrMmf2w7ccRW17QwNl8KmKJ_N2JjR4jddCG2W3fQ8zW6mwLJpW1MHbzB5Gpj2qW8Dqy2S3sdM9zW69Zkzq5dNS6gW7NWB6n1Xm0vBW8KGbpz3cBc68W3Hz8kW2xT1g0W30lSRK43XW_kW3sjShZ54d9XqW934vKP6P6VGCW8G_nPd7HthBwW6G55Kh2nqHzJW1Vn--5818bdyN7LtWZ2KbMYCf1Lrx-C04 ) of loneliness and isolation.

News Painting With Text, Voice, and Images ChatGPT is going multimodal with help from DALL·E. What’s new: ChatGPT is being geared to accept voice input and output, OpenAI announced (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRflg3prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3l9W3g9pg97Q_kWxVFd48J6qVz3lW4nGLb94NxjlTW3dd9c82fsJ4WW3tlJPg3XqnL1Vt6mgX5D5W9MW8xQjG74lr-ynW90sYXD7R54YDW1kktBl3pz2dTW71qpyV5qW90-W3-zYS68xqTWHW2c-XKN6hRnrLW2YsyS77zzVY8N5DFMbhT2Mq3W5y9Npn20bpLyV620nB9fgM-9W4kcJgq4cG7j-W5wxyRs1D4hyWW3yRPM53rg6hvW4hW9hB25dNVZW2lHdkz6LgcC2W3TmMVB2Kj_njW8mdFkg4WHXmCW3H6Bj246-CfCW8pH6F231cVw4W7f-bsJ1Dw3jJf1Lg0Jl04 ) .

How it works: The updates expand ChatGPT into a voice-controlled, interactive system for text and image interpretation and production. New safety features are designed to protect legal rights of artists and public figures. - Voice input/output will give ChatGPT functionality similar to that of Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa. OpenAI’s Whisper speech recognition system will transcribe voice input into text prompts, and a new text-to-speech model will render spoken output in five distinct voice profiles. Voice interactions will be available to subscribers to the paid ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise services within a couple of weeks. - A new model called GPT-4 with Vision (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRfk-3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3mNW8xM01c6HkJyGW5MBCjf8GDNQVW4LNLsg26Jg5-W8lsWFP60z8vWW7g55VT4fcYQSW65lvYD9hT_nZW6hkL_K6_tjWMW48HXhQ2x3ZTgW6YcXSN1crxLWW6XZ2Y02RNZvqW4PpgJM4zdrX5W4qHrC_5lzLrTW2dcF-Q77Z38RW7RR49g5D734DVPB0Qj53c__4W557Srs7vjfp4W7swLP018Ns83W5fh-Ps6JnQDBW3HZLr32dR7xYW70z1Cx2NNJ1zW6z6Ncq8y1jZtW7_KmhL5pNj_xW9f6y528T5LH_W2xdd-f4Z_jrlf4p-93P04 ) (GPT-4V) manages ChatGPT’s image input/output, which OpenAI demonstrated at GPT-4’s debut. Users can include images in a conversation to, say, analyze mathematical graphs or plan a meal around the photographed contents of a refrigerator. Like voice, image input/output will be available to paid subscribers within weeks. - DALL·E 3 will use ChatGPT to refine prompts, and it will generate images from much longer prompts than the previous version. It will produce legible text within images (rather than made-up characters and/or words). Among other safety features, it will decline prompts that name public figures or ask for art in the style of a living artist. The update will be available to paid subscribers in early October, and Microsoft Bing’s Image Creator (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRfkH3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mfW81cvPw7MySkHW5hytyH3kZmg4W7_lz666zHb0dW37FJ2B3VVcNdV2hP8x3DXD0lW7cCYKG6hX0fWW3rjqpM83j5NkN6BkwNP3Hfq6W6F-tWq71lMQkW3KHybL32Zs7VN4db3_2xlT30W1kf4k91w8l_SW5j03Dd5XMy0dW923Dlg5RL8c3W7gFFdF71jv5ZW3QHtF72QjgDLW5V8cD42G2DFYW7hqkMr15mxTQW94bTNy45nXKGV5LTx24hCX6NW2ftsmR6NKkwpW30njDY373NHzf6N4FMs04 ) will switch from DALL·E 2 to DALL·E 3. - All new functionality eventually will roll out to unpaid and API users. Yes, but: OpenAI said the new voice and image capabilities are limited to the English language. Moreover, the ability to understand and generate highly technical images is limited. Behind the news: OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March with a demo that translated a napkin sketch of a website into code, but Google was first to make visual input and output to a large language model widely available. Google announced visual features at May’s Google I/O conference and the public could use them by midsummer. Why it matters: ChatGPT has already redefined the possibilities of AI among the general public, businesses, and technical community alike. Voice input opens a world of new applications in any setting where English is spoken, and the coupling of language and vision is bound to spark applications in the arts, sciences, industry, and beyond. DALL·E 3’s safety features sound like an important step forward for image generation. We’re thinking: The notion of generative models that \"\"do everything (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRflg3prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3krW1d-Pz487sLKFW2F4FPs9jNWnjW1VLGWp8CqfGVW3Y113z6HFpMpW2vJ46B2_YZRZW8wGWYS15sZNTW47StfK4nd7D7W6gC9vq1TBcVzW7gy45F2VC4D6VjXTs06hdmPXW80g_6_5nZlmZW7bH2F55r461XW7hT_BG1fN3CnW3ZRfQG427GpCW4WmF3V4xQxttVPVvH19fgd3rW20BjQM99gSScW7MdwvV4BW2x_W69t0pR18M19xW7XpcJH5qsCfZV7S34_4sJwKhVS3hZP8FpsGPN6KPM2dKYgNNW5XKyMw9k7WfyN2YTjQrKyY5FW1ZCYY11zfd-cf5BlxjW04 ) \"\" has entered the public imagination. Combining text, voice, and image generation is an exciting step in that direction. Robots for Romance AI and dating may be a match made in heaven.

Users personalized their stand-ins by answering questions like “are you rational or emotional?” and “are you reserved or gregarious?” and conversing with a test chatbot. Teaser AI since has been replaced by a “personal matchmaker” app called Mila. - If your dating efforts end in heartbreak, Breakup Buddy (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVZ8z81DCs27W55zgZJ1TxMC4W8rPchQ53_sktMfRfkH3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3kSW7CcgJq7j33TsW11XD7c1VjPQXW5Dc7fn527HdFW5Yhdtx6XQXCRN1F1t796cJQ1W3RZ6t34SrWRRW2LMqm96VlFFMW3j943l3S8-bCW8PlXX54qBc3dW43wj9F79M007W3PZnHf6dzqN_W39mnkG2YtCQdW2W5qzR4sSQ2pVNFXLq2f61lHVDngrl7qNRSZW6hmXbZ4ssGbxW5XV68v54Kys8W2cP6Tz8-tSWQW5-P_d82FqY3xW5NWzL93R3J7MW2xZWBg2sVKkpW8m4WGp1PcXl6f3RrYjj04 ) aims to help you heal.

Why it matters: The combination of large language models and productivity software is a significant step. Microsoft’s approach seems likely to inspire millions of people who have never written a macro or opened the command line to start prompting AI models. We’re thinking: Copilot is a great concept. It helped make software engineers early adopters of large language models — for writing code, not prose. Energy-Efficient Cooling Google used DeepMind algorithms to dramatically boost energy efficiency in its data centers. More recent work adapts its approach to commercial buildings in general.

Key insight: Chiller plants cool air by running it past cold water or refrigerant. They’re typically controlled according to heuristics that, say, turn on or off certain pieces of equipment if the facility reaches a particular temperature, including constraints that protect against damaging the plant or exposing personnel to unsafe conditions. A neural network should be able to learn more energy-efficient strategies, but it must be trained in the real world (because current simulations don’t capture the complexity involved) and therefore it must adhere rigorously to safety constraints. To manage safety, the model can learn to predict the chiller plant’s future states, and a hard-coded subroutine can deem them safe or unsafe, guiding the neural network to choose only safe actions. How it works: The authors built separate systems to control chiller plants in two large commercial facilities. Each system comprised an ensemble of vanilla neural networks plus a safety module that enforced safety constraints. Training took place in two phases. In the first, the ensemble trained on data produced by a heuristic controller. In the second, it alternated between training on data produced by itself and the heuristic controller. - The authors collaborated with domain experts to determine a chiller plant’s potential actions and states. Actions comprised 12 behaviors such as switching on a component or setting a water chiller’s temperature. States consisted of measurements taken every 5 minutes by 50 sensors (temperature, water flow rate, on/off status of various components, and so on). They also identified unsafe actions (such as setting the temperature of the water running through a chiller to below 40 degrees) and unsafe states (such as a drop in ambient air temperature below 45 degrees). - The authors trained the ensemble on a year’s worth of data from the chiller plant’s heuristic controller via reinforcement learning, penalizing actions depending on how much energy they consumed. Given an action, it learned to predict (i) the energy cost of that action and (ii) the plant’s resulting state 15 minutes later. - For three months, they alternated between controlling the chiller plant using the ensemble for one day and the heuristic controller for one day. They recorded the actions and resulting states and added them to the training set. At the end of each day, they retrained the ensemble on the accumulated data. Alternating day by day made it possible to compare the performance of the ensemble and heuristic controller under similar conditions. - During this period, the safety module blocked the system from taking actions that were known to be unsafe and actions the ensemble predicted to result in an unsafe state. Of the remaining actions, the ensemble predicted the one that would consume the least energy. In most cases, it took that action. Occasionally, it took a different action, so it could discover strategies that were more energy-efficient than those it learned from the heuristic controller. Results: Alternating with the heuristics controller for three months in the two buildings, the authors’ method achieved energy savings of 9 percent and 13 percent, respectively, relative to the heuristic controller. Furthermore, the system made the chiller plants more efficient in interesting ways. For example, it learned to produce colder water, which consumed more energy up front but reduced the overall consumption. Yes, but: The environment within the buildings varied over the three-month period with respect to factors like temperature and equipment performance. This left the authors unable to tell how much improvement to attribute to their system versus confounding factors. Why it matters: Using reinforcement-learning algorithms to control expensive equipment requires significant domain expertise to account for variables like sensor calibration, maintenance schedules, and safety rules. Working closely with domain experts when applying such algorithms can maximize both efficiency and safety. We’re thinking: Deep learning is cooler than ever!

Mojo is a programming language that combines the usability of Python with the performance of C. It just came out this month, and already the freeCodeCamp community has developed a course for it. You\\'ll learn how to leverage Mojo\\'s strengths for developing AI systems. This beginner\\'s course will walk you through how Mojo works, and teach you its Data Types, Control Flow, Libraries, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/new-mojo-programming-language-for-ai-developers/ 2. Another emerging AI development tool is LangChain. It\\'s a framework for Python and JavaScript that makes it easier to build apps around Large Language Models like GPT4. LangChain can help you connect various data sources to your model – including your own databases. This project-based beginner\\'s course will teach you how to get started with LangChain by coding your own pet name generator. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-langchain-for-llm-development/ 3. But don\\'t think that freeCodeCamp is just focused on cutting edge AI tools. This week we also published a comprehensive crash course on Java. Learn why Java is celebrated as a “write once, run anywhere” programming language. You\\'ll get practice with Java fundamentals, and get exposure to the powerful Java Virtual Machine. The JVM handles memory management, garbage collection, multithreading, and even some of your application security. This course is a great place to get started with Java. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-java-programming/ 4. The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is an iconic optimization problem in computer science. Let\\'s say you\\'re in a hurry, and you need to pack your belongings into a knapsack that you can take with you. How do you maximize the value of your belongings given that you can only carry a certain amount of weight? To solve this problem, we\\'re going to use C# and a coding approach called Dynamic Programming. freeCodeCamp instructor Gavin Lon teaches this course, and he even plays some electric guitar in the video. I think you\\'ll dig it and learn a lot. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-dynamic-programming-to-solve-the-0-1-knapsack-problem/ 5. September 30th is World Translation Day. And the freeCodeCamp community is celebrating by publishing this full-length Localization Handbook that will show you how to translate your website or app into many world languages. Over the years, freeCodeCamp has published more than 11,000 coding tutorials. And we\\'re working to localize these into many languages, so everyone can benefit from them. If you or your friends grew up speaking a language other than English, I encourage you to get involved. We have powerful software to help you make the most of any time you\\'re able to volunteer. (full book): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/localization-book-how-to-translate-your-website The freeCodeCamp core curriculum is now available in so many world languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, and even Ukrainian. And this is all thanks to donations from kind folks who support our charity. I encourage you to get involved in our mission to build open learning resources for everyone on Earth: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate Quote of the Week: “Too many apparently “simple” technologies merely shift the complexity to other places: higher level tools, frameworks, package managers, wrappers, syntax extensions, etc. But well designed systems are simple to learn and use end-to-end, while permitting experts to build amazing things.” — Chris Lattner, software engineer and designer of both the Mojo and Swift programming languages Until next week, happy coding.

IEEE President Saifur Rahman and IEEE Educational Activities Vice President Rabab Ward will kick off the event on *Tuesday 24 October at 10am ET*. IEEE recognizes the importance of STEM outreach for school-aged children. Student interest in STEM careers can be ignited through exposure to new technologies. Fostering a community where educators and IEEE Members can share ideas and experiences is essential to creating an engaging STEM curriculum. In past years, hundreds of participants used the Summit as a chance to pose questions to award-winning educators and knowledgeable volunteers, who offered practical advice on how to plan interesting and effective outreach activities. This year, four keynote speakers will present on a range of STEM-themed and youth empowerment topics. The program will feature sessions covering various topics on STEM outreach resources provided by TryEngineering . IEEE Volunteers will also present sessions related to their technical affiliations and affinity groups. Resources to promote the event to educators and STEM enthusiasts can be found in the STEM Summit Outreach Toolkit ,This toolkit includes sample invitation templates, images, ads, flyers, and the TryEngineering STEM Summit social media calendar . *Register today for the IEEE STEM Summit.* Together, let’s create a thriving community of pre-university educators and volunteers that can inspire tomorrow’s engineers today.

VS Code is a powerful code editor used by pretty much every developer on freeCodeCamp\\'s team, and most of the other developers I know, too. But much of its power is non-obvious. So freeCodeCamp published this comprehensive beginner-to-advanced VS Code course. It will help you navigate VS Code\\'s Command Palette, customized themes, keyboard shortcuts, and its library of extensions for React, GitHub, and more. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/increase-your-vs-code-productivity/ 2. Arduino is a popular open source hardware project. You can use Arduino microcontrollers to build musical instruments, automate your home, prototype your electronics, or even gather climate data for a farm. This week freeCodeCamp published our Arduino Handbook to help you learn the Arduino programming language and how to leverage its powerful ecosystem of tools. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-arduino-handbook 3. Learn how to build and deploy your own Ecommerce app using the latest version of the popular Next.js framework. You\\'ll build a fully-functional shop complete with authentication and shopping cart functionality. You can code along at home and use the latest tools for everything: Tailwind CSS, the daisyUI component library, Prisma and MongoDB for data storage, and Vercel for deploying your shop to the cloud. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ecommerce-site-with-next-js-tailwind-daisyui-course 4. freeCodeCamp also published a course on coding your own developer portfolio page using the SvelteKit web development framework and Tailwind CSS. This course will teach you how to build user interfaces quickly without having to micro-manage your CSS. You\\'ll even implement particle effects. Spend an hour of your week getting some exposure to these powerful tools. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-sveltekit-and-tailwind-css-by-building-a-web-portfolio/ 5. With all these recent breaches, API security has become a hot topic among developers. So, of course, freeCodeCamp is coming in clutch with this API security course. 20-year industry veteran Dan Barahona dives deep into PCI-DSS (the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). This set of rules governs online transactions. If your app or website does anything related to commerce, these best practices will help keep you and your customers secure. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/api-security-for-pci-compliance/ Finally, I\\'m thrilled to announce that the freeCodeCamp Portuguese podcast is now live. Each week, Nielda Karla interviews developers about their coding journeys, and the work they\\'re doing in tech: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-portuguese-podcast You can subscribe to this and our other podcasts in your podcast player of choice. Rafael hosts our Spanish podcast, Miya hosts our Chinese podcast, and I host our English podcast, which will publish a special 100th episode this weekend. All of these courses, books, and podcasts are made possible thanks to the 8,027 kind folks who donate each month to support our charity. You should get involved, too. Help us in our mission to create even more open learning resources for every human being on the planet: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate Quote of the Week: “Just like with everything else, tools won\\'t give you good results unless you know how, when, and why to apply them. If you go out and you buy the most expensive frying pan on the market, it\\'s still not going to make you a good chef.” — Dr. Christin Wiedemann, Software Engineer and Physicist Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren\\'t worth your time, you can turn them off: https://www.freecodecamp.org/ue/b6S73EiNQbTSWOYGVoHL\"\\n', '\"Kaggle Hi Aayush Senapati, The most lethal female reproductive system cancer is ovarian carcinoma. Treatments specific to each of the five common subtypes (also referred to as histotypes) are gaining prominence but first require accurate subtype identification. In this competition, you\\'ll build a model that classifies ovarian cancer subtypes using the world\\'s most extensive and diverse ovarian cancer dataset of histopathology images from more than 20 medical centers. Total Prizes: $50,000 Entry Deadline: December 27, 2023 Learn More Machine learning models that could aid pathologists in diagnosing ovarian cancer subtypes (especially in community hospitals and remote regions) will enable more personalized treatment strategies and lead to better patient outcomes.

Hi Aayush, Registration for the IEEEXtreme Competition will close on Saturday, 14 October 2023! IEEEXtreme is a global, virtual challenge in which teams of IEEE Student Members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. Learn more about the competition at https://ieeextreme.org/ . This year’s competition will be held on 28 October at 00:00:00 UTC. As a global competition, IEEEXtreme is always virtual. Typically, students would compete with their team and their proctor in the same location, in most cases at their local Student Branch. The IEEEXtreme committee also allows teams to compete using online Video Conferencing Platforms in case teams and proctors cannot be in the same physical location. Get your team together and register today. Together, you can prepare for the competition by visiting our Practice Community where you can find and solve challenges from previous IEEEXtreme competitions. ${sec2-col1-btn-text} Good luck!

Dear Friends, Join in on this workshop where we will showcase some powerful metrics to evaluate the quality of the inputs and outputs with a focus on both RAG and fine-tuning use cases. In the context of LLMs, “hallucination” refers to a phenomenon where the model generates text that is incorrect, nonsensical, or not real. Since LLMs are not databases or search engines, they would not cite where their response is based on. These models generate text as an extrapolation from the prompt you provided. What attendees can expect to takeaway from the workshop: - Deep dive into research-backed metrics to evaluate the quality of the inputs (data quality, RAG context quality, etc) and outputs (hallucinations) while building LLM powered applications - Evaluation and experimentation framework while prompt engineering with RAG, as well as while fine-tuning with your own data - Demo led practical guide to building guardrails and mitigating hallucinations while building LLM powered applications Can\\'t attend live?

We challenged participants to write in-depth essays on important topics like generative AI and AI ethics and recruited a panel of Kaggle grandmasters to select those included in the report. We\\'re blown away by the results and are excited by how this collection of essays covers such a wide array of insights and advancements in our field, as told through the collective mindshare of the Kaggle community – a big thank you to all who participated. We hope you enjoy!

Set a pre-deploy command for your service: https://render.com/docs/deploys#deploy-steps This command runs right before a new version of your service goes live (and it doesn\\'t run if your build fails). This is extra handy for services that deploy a prebuilt Docker image, because they haven\\'t been able to fold these kinds of tasks into the build command. See the blog post: https://render.com/blog/build-pipeline#pre-deploy-command # Run your builds with more RAM and CPU Teams on Render can now enable the Performance build pipeline: https://render.com/docs/build-pipeline#pipeline-tiers This runs all of your team\\'s builds on compute with 8x the RAM and CPU of default build instances. If your builds are currently hitting a resource limit, the Performance pipeline provides a whole lot more headroom. See the blog post: https://render.com/blog/build-pipeline#performance-build-pipeline # Assign access roles to team members Teams on Render now support two member roles: Admin and Developer. Only Admin members can perform organizational tasks like billing management, enforcement of 2FA, and inviting other team members. See the docs: https://render.com/docs/teams#manage-team-members # Skip an unnecessary pull request preview Pull request previews help you and your team test out proposed changes, but some pull requests don\\'t have any changes to test (like one that just updates a README). In these cases, you can now include the string \"\"[skip render]\"\" (or a couple other options) in your pull request\\'s title to tell Render not to generate a preview instance. See the docs: https://render.com/docs/pull-request-previews#skipping-a-pr-preview # Learn Render with Codecademy Our friends over at Codecademy released a new intermediate-level course all about deploying with Render. Check it out: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploying-with-render -- Thoughts or feedback? Let us know in our Community (https://community.render.com/), or by replying to this email.

Hi Aayush, Registration for the IEEEXtreme Competition Extended Until 23 October 2023! IEEEXtreme is a global, virtual challenge in which teams of IEEE Student Members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. Learn more about the competition at https://ieeextreme.org/ . This year’s competition will be held on 28 October at 00:00:00 UTC. As a global competition, IEEEXtreme is always virtual. Typically, students would compete with their team and their proctor in the same location, in most cases at their local Student Branch. The IEEEXtreme committee also allows teams to compete using online Video Conferencing Platforms in case teams and proctors cannot be in the same physical location. Get your team together and register today. Together, you can prepare for the competition by visiting our Practice Community where you can find and solve challenges from previous IEEEXtreme competitions. ${sec2-col1-btn-text} Good luck!

I understand that you people are waiting to get the clarity on this part ASAP and so are we. Kindly note the following: 1. Experiential learning or Assignment component for Big Data will have 20 marks weightage. 2. ISA1 and ISA 2 will be conducted for 40 marks each and would be reduced to 15 each later. Making a total of 30 marks. 3. For the Experiential learning of 20 marks, break up would be as given below. *Coding assignments, TWO - each evaluated for 10 marks - scaled down to 5. This activity would be an individual activity and the code solution should be submitted to the auto evaluation portal. Detailed instructions and a dry run would be conducted at suitable time to give you clarity.* *Class Project - Team activity (10 marks, no scale down). Team of 4 members *have to be formed for this part - post ISA1, there will be a form shared to get these entries. *Teams within a teacher section *would be preferred for logistics purposes. However the later demo/viva part would be assigned to random teachers to keep up with the uniformity. Current plan is to evaluate the project problem statement as Hackathon, with sufficient prior start. More details would be shared at the appropriate time. *Please get yourself ready for the Assignment 1. Tentatively this would be released by this weekend. You will have to get a working Hadoop installation for this to begin with. The TA team will update you on this soon. * Any further queries, please feel free to discuss with your teachers and/or me during class hours or later as well. with regards, Dr. Prafullata Kiran Auradkar, Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Science and Engg.

This assignment has to be performed individually and required to submit the assignment on the portal https://bigdata-pesu.tech (the portal is closed now and we will communicate with you the opening time soon). Some guidelines to use the portal: - You can make as many submissions you want on the portal until you get the right answer. - Marks displayed on the portal are not your final marks. Your final marks will be compiled after running a plagiarism check on code. - If you misuse the portal in any way that causes Denial of Service for other teams, your team will be blacklisted from making submissions. - If you find any bugs, please report it to us at bigdata@pes.edu Please find attached the manual for Assignment 1. Make sure you keep checking the portal for any notifications about the submission timeline. *Submission Deadline: 17th September, 2023.* -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"\"Big Data RR Campus 2023\"\" group.

For more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\"\\n', '\"Dear Students, A few suggestions to add to the list of guidelines already shared with you. Please note that, - as it is an individual assignment: each one of you will have your own coding style. Though you can discuss some possible choices for solutions/approaches for a given task, do not share the codes. - It has happened before, that somebody shares a code that is not working. This would be one time where you might as well get to know your friendships :) - All sorts of permutations and combinations: mapper from some team, reducer from some other team, cross-campus team work etc. are not new to us. Plagiarism checkers work on all such concoctions and we take them very seriously. Please avoid being in such a spot. - For task 2: Please think through your approach. Break down your tasks to some workable modules and try them separately. Later you can start coding your approach. - For the three sets of mapper and reducers: though it is one job, you can figure out your own way to manage the intermediate outputs and inputs from M to R. For any clarifications you can approach your TAs during break times or after class hours. Location: CCBD at RR campus. EC campus you could check the arrangement there. - Out of the 10 days given, it would be good to try and get done with Task 1 in a day or two. Focus the other days on the parts of Task2. Please do not wait till the end or for a week end. I do not have to repeat *not to wait for anybody to share a code: working or not working.* - *This assignment will be evaluated for 10 marks to be scaled down to 5 later. Both tasks DO NOT HAVE EQUAL WEIGHTAGE. * - *once the submissions are closed - plagiarism checker will be executed and we would publish the final marks then. * Happy Learning.Enjoy the problem solving and coding.

The fastest-growing digital and human skills 2. Emerging/new technical roles and opportunity areas 3. What skill sets are at a premium from an industry perspective? Biggest Employer-Employee gap in skills/expectations? 4. Skills/competencies/potential that universities are looking at for incoming students (for MS in tech and related areas) 5. Discussion on how you can work on these skills to intercept the new opportunities *About the Speaker:* During 20yrs at Intel (US/India), spanning roles in Strategic Planning, Product Management, and R&D, Prof. Sathya Prasad successfully conceived, designed, and took to market several leading-edge tech products.

Hess, Director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute “As AI becomes more ubiquitous, education should prepare students to a) learn how to use these tools effectively; and b) how to exercise judgment about why, when, where, and under what circumstances they should be deployed.” [Image \"\"2.jpg\"\"] I Caught a Student Using ChatGPT. How Should a School Respond? By Matt T., New York City High-School Civics Teacher “While I am disappointed with the student who submitted this, and while schools are stepping up their surveillance and censorship on student devices as a response, I believe that AI should cause us to reevaluate why students are using these tools in the first place.” [Image \"\"3.jpg\"\"] Laziness Does Not Exist—But Unseen Barriers Do By Devon Price, PhD, Social Psychologist, Writer, Activist, and Professor “When I see a student failing to complete assignments, missing deadlines, or not delivering results in other aspects of their life, I’m moved to ask: what are the situational factors holding this student back? What needs are currently not being met?” [Image \"\"4.jpg\"\"] AI and Creative Learning: Concerns, Opportunities, and Choices By Mitchel Resnick, Professor of Learning Research at MIT Media Lab “We shouldn’t expect (or want) AI systems to play the same role as human tutors or coaches or companions. Rather, we should consider AI systems as a new category of educational resource, with their own affordances and limitations.” [Image \"\"5.jpg\"\"] How to Email Your Professor (Without Being Annoying AF) By Laura Portwood-Stacer, former Assistant Professor at NYU “My professor friends, they are annoyed. Their students do not know how to write emails, they say. What they really mean is that their students don’t know how to follow the conventions of email etiquette in the academy.” [Image \"\"6.jpg\"\"] This Year, Give Teachers What They Really Need: A Freaking Break By Thomas Rademacher, 2014 Minnesota Teacher of the Year “Let’s stop planning for a shortage of teachers by pretending any piece of software will ever do the job, and start doing more to make teachers able to stay.” [Image \"\"7.jpg\"\"] What It Feels Like to Be in High School Right Now By Linda Xiao, High-School Student “Writing this, with a G1 driver’s license in my wallet and a bank account (I think?), I am struck with the realization that my childhood has silently passed me by in the blink of an eye.” Join Medium\"\\n', '\"---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Harish Naik B M faculty CSE RR campus PESU Date: Thu, 14 Sep, 2023, 10:30 Subject: Fwd: Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023 - Please share this info with your students To: ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: *PESU Chairperson CSE,RR Campus PESU* Date: Wednesday, September 13, 2023 Subject: Fwd: Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023 - Please share this info with your students To: Harish Naik B M faculty CSE RR campus PESU Dear Harish, Please fwd it to student groups ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: CIE Office PES University Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2023, 8:49 pm Subject: Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023 - Please share this info with your students To: PESU Chairperson ECE,RR Campus PESU , PESU Chairperson CSE,RR Campus PESU , PESU Chairperson CSE,EC Campus PESU , PESU-EC-ECE Chairperson < ece.ec.chairperson@pes.edu>, Dr.Keshavan k , Dr. Subhash Kulkarni PESSE ECE , Shanti Koppala PESIT BEBT < shantikoppala@pes.edu>, Dean Student Affairs PES University < dean.studentaffairs@pes.edu>, Dean Engineering , CHITRA VISWANATHAN Director For Design PES University < chitravishwanathan@pes.edu>, rajesh mathivanan a Cc: Sathya Prasad PESU CIE , Registrar PES University Dear Deans and Chairpersons, Please share the below info with your students Thanks and Regards, *Madhukar Narasimha* Program Manager, Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) PES University , Bengaluru, India Mob: 9886639660 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Title: *Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023 - MathWorks Problem Statement - PES Selection round* *Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023* is back!

Do not disrespect the people assisting the smooth movement of students and cut the line and move around or block the way of others by standing in the corridors - Use *black pen* for bubbling and writing the answers. Enter the test center 10 minutes before the schedule and correctly bubble your SRN and Subject Code (Do not write your PRN) - MCQs have to be answered in the terminal. Subjective questions can be answered in the terminal or in the answer booklet. Only bubble the question numbers that you are answering in the booklet. Hope you will help the department in helping you with the smooth conduction of the ISAs. All the very best for the ISAs.

These changes were made based on feedback from our community, and we want to ensure you’re aware. We also invite you to read the FAQ ( https://unity.com/pricing-updates ) for more details. At a high level, this is what we’re changing: * *Unity Personal: No Runtime Fee, splash screen optional.* The Unity Personal plan will remain free and there will be no Runtime Fees for games built with the plan. We will be increasing the revenue limit from $100,000 USD to $200,000 USD and we will remove the requirement to use the Made with Unity splash screen (starting with the LTS version releasing in 2024, currently referred to as the 2023 LTS, or later). * *Runtime Fee is forward-looking.* For Unity Pro & Enterprise, the Runtime Fee does not apply to any games created with any currently supported Unity versions. It only applies to games created with or upgraded to the LTS version releasing in 2024 (currently referred to as the 2023 LTS) or later. * *Editor Terms.* We will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity you are using - as long as you keep using that version. * *Runtime Fee, self-reported.* On a monthly basis, you have a choice of the lesser of 2.5% revenue share or the calculated amount based on unique initial engagements. Both are self-reported from data you already have available. You will always be billed the lesser amount. We understand that you may still have questions after reading our letter and the FAQ ( https://unity.com/pricing-updates ). To get answers, we invite you to join us for a live fireside chat with Marc Whitten, President of Unity Create, hosted by Jason Weimann, industry veteran and content creator, on his YouTube channel ( https://youtube.com/live/qyLcI5O9iUY ) , today at 4:00 pm ET/ 1:00 pm PT.

I’m reaching out to invite your students to participate in this year’s annual Adobe Analytics Challenge – an exciting competition for university students from around the world. Since its inception in 2005, the Adobe Analytics Challenge has grown into the #1 international business case competition for cash prizes, internships, and full-time offers. The Challenge is a unique analytics-focused business case competition where university students are given the opportunity to use Adobe Analytics with real-world data from leading organizations. Last year over 7000 students from over 600 universities across 24 different countries competed for $60,000 in cash prizes. Over the years, Adobe and its AAC client partners (Disney, Nike, T-Mobile, Sony PlayStation, etc.) have interviewed hundreds of students for full-time and intern positions. Adobe has hired more than 60 students from this program across a wide array of roles from engineering to corporate strategy. We need your help getting the word out to your students. Attached to this email you will find a flyer and some basic slides that will answer any questions that come up. We’ve also set up a self-explanatory website with registration information, key dates, and other important details at adobeanalyticschallenge.com. With your help, we’ll have another highly successful competition!

To get started, I recommend that you visit the OCI documentation and familiarize yourself with different services and features that are available. You can also find a number of helpful tutorials and guides on the OCI website. Feel free to circle back at your earliest convenience. I’d be glad to give you a more formal introduction of myself and my role here at Oracle, as well as learn more about what you’re hoping to accomplish.

But what if data science could measure and track key aspects of the writing process itself that reliably produces quality writing? In this competition, you\\'ll develop a model that can predict overall writing quality based on a large dataset of keystroke logs that capture the writing process. Total Prizes: $55,000 Entry Deadline: January 2nd, 2024 Learn More Your work will help explore the relationship between learners\\' writing behaviors and writing performance. This could provide insights for writing instruction, developing automated writing evaluation techniques, or intelligent tutoring systems.

After expiration, subsequent actions from the end user’s browser (e.g. input email/password, redirect back to Actions/Rules, etc.) will result in either: - Redirect to the associated application’s default login route to reinitiate the flow as a new login transaction, or - Serve an error page if the default login route is not configured. The end user will need to come back to your application to reinitiate the login transaction. You can customize this error page. To learn more, read the “What action do you need to take?” section. Why are we making this change? Our main motivation is to provide a more secure platform for our customers. The longer a login transaction takes, the more vulnerable it is to malicious attacks. In all Identity systems and solutions, some transactions last longer than what is normally required by legitimate use cases, mainly due to users leaving the flow and returning at a later time. This extended transaction is a dangerous security practice that does not enhance the user experience. That is the reason for limiting this lifetime to 1 hour: improve security while not affecting the user experience. How are you affected? You are minimally affected. Less than 1% of the transactions for your tenant last longer than 1 hour, and only a small portion of your login transactions will need to be reinitiated after the 1-hour expiration. We still recommend that you consider the actions explained in the next section for the best user experience. What action do you need to take? We highly recommend you configure default login routes for your applications in Auth0 Dashboard or via the Auth0 Management API. This method automatically starts login transactions and results in the best user experience as the login flow seamlessly restarts for active end users when the transaction is expired. If your configuration doesn’t allow use of default login routes, we recommend that you customize Auth0 error pages to provide a better user experience. You will be able to use the error pages to instruct the user to come back to your application to restart the login attempt. If you don’t do any of the above, we will display the default Auth0 error page , which will appear similar to the following: How can you get additional assistance? We are here to help.

In case of an eSign option is made available, client should be given an option to choose the specific purpose(s) of DDPI\"\". Do\\'s & Dont\\'s 1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15. Check messages sent by Exchanges on a weekly basis regarding funds and securities balances reported by the trading member and immediately raise a concern to the exchange if you notice a discrepancy. 16.

In case of an eSign option is made available, client should be given an option to choose the specific purpose(s) of DDPI\"\". Do\\'s & Dont\\'s 1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15. Check messages sent by Exchanges on a weekly basis regarding funds and securities balances reported by the trading member and immediately raise a concern to the exchange if you notice a discrepancy. 16. Do not share password (internet account) with anyone. It is like sharing your safe key. 17. Please do not transfer funds, for the purposes of trading to anyone, including an authorized person or an associate of the broker, other than a SEBI registered Stock broker. निवेशक क्या करें और क्या न करें: 1. केवल रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के साथ ही व्यवहार/अनुबंध करें - जिस ब्रोकर के साथ आप लेन-देन कर रहे हों, उसके रेजिस्ट्रेशन सर्टिफिकेट की जाँच कर लें। यह नियामक कार्रवाई के लिए सहारा देता है। 2. फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन प्लान्स से सावधान रहें। ब्रोकर या उनके औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या उनका कोई भी प्रतिनिधि/कर्मचारी आपके निवेश पर फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन देने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है या आपके द्वारा दिये गए पैसो पर ब्याज का भुगतान करने के लिए आपके साथ कोई लोन समझौता करने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है। कृपया ध्यान दें कि किसी भी व्यवस्था / सांकेतिक रिटर्न के समझौते के तहत ब्रोकर को दिए गए फंड या सेक्युरिटीज़ के दावे आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा चूक होने पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा स्वीकार नहीं किया जाएगा । 3. कृपया आपने \\'केवाईसी\\' (KYC) पेपर में सभी जरूरी जानकारी खुद भरें और ब्रोकर से अपने \\'केवाईसी\\' पेपर की नियम अनुसार साइन की हुई प्रति प्राप्त करें। उन सभी शर्तों की जांच करें जिन्हें आपने सहमति और स्वीकृति दी है। 4. सुनिश्चित करें कि आपके स्टॉक ब्रोकर के पास हमेशा आपका नया और सही कांटैक्ट डिटेल हो जैसे ईमेल आईडी/मोबाइल नंबर। ईमेल और मोबाइल नंबर जरूरी है और एक्सचेंज रिकॉर्ड में अपडेट के लिए आपको अपने ब्रोकर को मोबाइल नंबर देना होगा। यदि आपको एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी से नियमित रूप से संदेश नहीं मिल रहे हैं, तो आपको स्टॉक ब्रोकर/एक्सचेंज के पास इस मामले को उठाना चाहिए। 5. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक (ई-मेल) कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट्स/फाइनेंशियल डिटेल्स का चयन सिर्फ तभी करें जब आप खुद कंप्यूटर के जानकार हों और आपका अपना ई-मेल अकाउंट हो और आप उसे प्रतिदिन/नियमित देखते हो। 6. आपके द्वारा किए गए ट्रेड के लिए एक्सचेंज से प्राप्त हुए किसी भी ईमेल/एसएमएस को अनदेखा न करें। अपने ब्रोकर से मिले कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट/अकाउंट के डिटेल से इसे वेरिफ़ाई करें। यदि कोई गड़बड़ी हो, तो अपने ब्रोकर को तुरंत इसके बारे में लिखित रूप से सूचित करें और यदि स्टॉक ब्रोकर जवाब नहीं देता है, तो एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी को तुरंत रिपोर्ट करें। 7. आपके द्वारा निश्चित की गई अकाउंट के सेटलमेंट कि फ्रिक्वेन्सी की जांच करें। यदि आपने रनिंग अकाउंट का ऑप्शन चुना है, तो कृपया कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपका ब्रोकर आपके अकाउंट का नियमित रूप से सेटलमेंट करता है और किसी भी स्थिति में 90 दिनों में एक बार ( यदि आपने 30 दिनों के सेटलमेंट का विकल्प चुना है तो 30 दिन) डिटेल्स भेजता है । कृपया ध्यान दें कि आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा डिफॉल्ट होने की स्थिति में एक्सचेंज द्वारा 90 दिनों से अधिक की अवधि के दावे एक्सैप्ट नहीं किए जाएंगे। 8. डिपॉजिटरी से प्राप्त अकाउंट की जानकारी (कंसोलिडेटेड अकाउंट स्टेटमेंट - सी ये एस) नियमित रूप से वेरिफ़ाई करते रहें और अपने ट्रेड/लेनदेन के साथ सामंजस्य स्थापित करें। 9. कन्फ़र्म करें कि पे-आउट की तारीख से 1 वर्किंग डे के भीतर आपके खाते में धनराशि/सिक्योरिटी (शेयर) का पेमेंट हो गया हो। कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपको अपने ट्रेड के 24 घंटों के भीतर कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट मिलते हों। 10. एनएसई की वेबसाइट पर ट्रेड वेरिफिकेशन की सुविधा भी उपलब्ध है जिसका उपयोग आप अपने ट्रेड के वेरिफिकेशन के लिए कर सकते हैं। 11. ब्रोकर के पास अनावश्यक बैलेंस न रखें। कृपया ध्यान रहे कि ब्रोकर के दिवालिया निष्कासित होने पर उन खातों के दावे स्वीकार नहीं होंगे जिनमें 90 दिन से कोई ट्रेड ना हुआ हो। 12. ब्रोकर्स को सिक्यूरिटि के ट्रांसफर को मार्जिन के रूप में स्वीकार करने की अनुमति नहीं है। मार्जिन के रूप में दी जाने वाली सिक्योरिटी ग्राहक के अकाउंट में ही रहनी चाहिए और यह ब्रोकर को गिरवी रखी जा सकती हैं। ग्राहकों को किसी भी कारण से ब्रोकर या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी या ब्रोकर के औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति के साथ कोई सिक्यूरिटी रखने की अनुमति नहीं है। ब्रोकर केवल कस्टमर द्वारा बेची गई सिक्योरिटी के डिपोजिट करने के लिए ग्राहकों से संबंधित सिक्योरिटी ले सकता है। 13. भारी मुनाफे का वादा करने वाले शेयर/सिक्योरिटी में व्यापार करने का लालच देकर ईमेल और एसएमएस भेजने वाले धोखेबाजों के झांसे में न आएं। 14. पीओए (पावर ऑफ अटॉर्नी) देते समय सावधान रहें - सभी अधिकार जिनका स्टॉक ब्रोकर प्रयोग कर सकते हैं और समय सीमा जिसके लिए पीओए मान्य है, इसे स्पष्ट रूप से बताएँ। यह ध्यान रहे कि सेबी/एक्सचेंजों के अनुसार पीओए अनिवार्य / आवश्यक नहीं है। 15. ब्रोकर द्वारा रिपोर्ट किए गए फंड और सिक्योरिटी बैलेंस के बारे में साप्ताहिक आधार पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा भेजे गए मैसेजों की जांच करें और यदि आप इसमें कोई अंतर पाते हैं, तो तुरंत एक्सचेंज को शिकायत करें। 16. किसी के साथ पासवर्ड (इंटरनेट अकाउंट) शेयर न करें। ऐसा करना अपने सुरक्षित पैसे शेयर करने जैसा है। 17. कृपया सेबी के रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के अलावा किसी औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी सहित किसी को भी ट्रेडिंग के उद्देश्य से फंड ट्रांसफर न करें। This is a system generated email, do not reply to this email id.

Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15. Check messages sent by Exchanges on a weekly basis regarding funds and securities balances reported by the trading member and immediately raise a concern to the exchange if you notice a discrepancy. 16. Do not share password (internet account) with anyone. It is like sharing your safe key. 17. Please do not transfer funds, for the purposes of trading to anyone, including an authorized person or an associate of the broker, other than a SEBI registered Stock broker. निवेशक क्या करें और क्या न करें: 1. केवल रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के साथ ही व्यवहार/अनुबंध करें - जिस ब्रोकर के साथ आप लेन-देन कर रहे हों, उसके रेजिस्ट्रेशन सर्टिफिकेट की जाँच कर लें। यह नियामक कार्रवाई के लिए सहारा देता है। 2. फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन प्लान्स से सावधान रहें। ब्रोकर या उनके औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या उनका कोई भी प्रतिनिधि/कर्मचारी आपके निवेश पर फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन देने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है या आपके द्वारा दिये गए पैसो पर ब्याज का भुगतान करने के लिए आपके साथ कोई लोन समझौता करने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है। कृपया ध्यान दें कि किसी भी व्यवस्था / सांकेतिक रिटर्न के समझौते के तहत ब्रोकर को दिए गए फंड या सेक्युरिटीज़ के दावे आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा चूक होने पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा स्वीकार नहीं किया जाएगा । 3. कृपया आपने \\'केवाईसी\\' (KYC) पेपर में सभी जरूरी जानकारी खुद भरें और ब्रोकर से अपने \\'केवाईसी\\' पेपर की नियम अनुसार साइन की हुई प्रति प्राप्त करें। उन सभी शर्तों की जांच करें जिन्हें आपने सहमति और स्वीकृति दी है। 4. सुनिश्चित करें कि आपके स्टॉक ब्रोकर के पास हमेशा आपका नया और सही कांटैक्ट डिटेल हो जैसे ईमेल आईडी/मोबाइल नंबर। ईमेल और मोबाइल नंबर जरूरी है और एक्सचेंज रिकॉर्ड में अपडेट के लिए आपको अपने ब्रोकर को मोबाइल नंबर देना होगा। यदि आपको एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी से नियमित रूप से संदेश नहीं मिल रहे हैं, तो आपको स्टॉक ब्रोकर/एक्सचेंज के पास इस मामले को उठाना चाहिए। 5. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक (ई-मेल) कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट्स/फाइनेंशियल डिटेल्स का चयन सिर्फ तभी करें जब आप खुद कंप्यूटर के जानकार हों और आपका अपना ई-मेल अकाउंट हो और आप उसे प्रतिदिन/नियमित देखते हो। 6. आपके द्वारा किए गए ट्रेड के लिए एक्सचेंज से प्राप्त हुए किसी भी ईमेल/एसएमएस को अनदेखा न करें। अपने ब्रोकर से मिले कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट/अकाउंट के डिटेल से इसे वेरिफ़ाई करें। यदि कोई गड़बड़ी हो, तो अपने ब्रोकर को तुरंत इसके बारे में लिखित रूप से सूचित करें और यदि स्टॉक ब्रोकर जवाब नहीं देता है, तो एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी को तुरंत रिपोर्ट करें। 7. आपके द्वारा निश्चित की गई अकाउंट के सेटलमेंट कि फ्रिक्वेन्सी की जांच करें। यदि आपने रनिंग अकाउंट का ऑप्शन चुना है, तो कृपया कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपका ब्रोकर आपके अकाउंट का नियमित रूप से सेटलमेंट करता है और किसी भी स्थिति में 90 दिनों में एक बार ( यदि आपने 30 दिनों के सेटलमेंट का विकल्प चुना है तो 30 दिन) डिटेल्स भेजता है । कृपया ध्यान दें कि आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा डिफॉल्ट होने की स्थिति में एक्सचेंज द्वारा 90 दिनों से अधिक की अवधि के दावे एक्सैप्ट नहीं किए जाएंगे। 8. डिपॉजिटरी से प्राप्त अकाउंट की जानकारी (कंसोलिडेटेड अकाउंट स्टेटमेंट - सी ये एस) नियमित रूप से वेरिफ़ाई करते रहें और अपने ट्रेड/लेनदेन के साथ सामंजस्य स्थापित करें। 9. कन्फ़र्म करें कि पे-आउट की तारीख से 1 वर्किंग डे के भीतर आपके खाते में धनराशि/सिक्योरिटी (शेयर) का पेमेंट हो गया हो। कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपको अपने ट्रेड के 24 घंटों के भीतर कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट मिलते हों। 10. एनएसई की वेबसाइट पर ट्रेड वेरिफिकेशन की सुविधा भी उपलब्ध है जिसका उपयोग आप अपने ट्रेड के वेरिफिकेशन के लिए कर सकते हैं। 11. ब्रोकर के पास अनावश्यक बैलेंस न रखें। कृपया ध्यान रहे कि ब्रोकर के दिवालिया निष्कासित होने पर उन खातों के दावे स्वीकार नहीं होंगे जिनमें 90 दिन से कोई ट्रेड ना हुआ हो। 12. ब्रोकर्स को सिक्यूरिटि के ट्रांसफर को मार्जिन के रूप में स्वीकार करने की अनुमति नहीं है। मार्जिन के रूप में दी जाने वाली सिक्योरिटी ग्राहक के अकाउंट में ही रहनी चाहिए और यह ब्रोकर को गिरवी रखी जा सकती हैं। ग्राहकों को किसी भी कारण से ब्रोकर या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी या ब्रोकर के औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति के साथ कोई सिक्यूरिटी रखने की अनुमति नहीं है। ब्रोकर केवल कस्टमर द्वारा बेची गई सिक्योरिटी के डिपोजिट करने के लिए ग्राहकों से संबंधित सिक्योरिटी ले सकता है। 13. भारी मुनाफे का वादा करने वाले शेयर/सिक्योरिटी में व्यापार करने का लालच देकर ईमेल और एसएमएस भेजने वाले धोखेबाजों के झांसे में न आएं। 14. पीओए (पावर ऑफ अटॉर्नी) देते समय सावधान रहें - सभी अधिकार जिनका स्टॉक ब्रोकर प्रयोग कर सकते हैं और समय सीमा जिसके लिए पीओए मान्य है, इसे स्पष्ट रूप से बताएँ। यह ध्यान रहे कि सेबी/एक्सचेंजों के अनुसार पीओए अनिवार्य / आवश्यक नहीं है। 15. ब्रोकर द्वारा रिपोर्ट किए गए फंड और सिक्योरिटी बैलेंस के बारे में साप्ताहिक आधार पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा भेजे गए मैसेजों की जांच करें और यदि आप इसमें कोई अंतर पाते हैं, तो तुरंत एक्सचेंज को शिकायत करें। 16. किसी के साथ पासवर्ड (इंटरनेट अकाउंट) शेयर न करें। ऐसा करना अपने सुरक्षित पैसे शेयर करने जैसा है। 17. कृपया सेबी के रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के अलावा किसी औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी सहित किसी को भी ट्रेडिंग के उद्देश्य से फंड ट्रांसफर न करें। This is a system generated email, do not reply to this email id.

In case of an eSign option is made available, client should be given an option to choose the specific purpose(s) of DDPI\"\". Do\\'s & Dont\\'s 1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15. Check messages sent by Exchanges on a weekly basis regarding funds and securities balances reported by the trading member and immediately raise a concern to the exchange if you notice a discrepancy. 16. Do not share password (internet account) with anyone. It is like sharing your safe key. 17. Please do not transfer funds, for the purposes of trading to anyone, including an authorized person or an associate of the broker, other than a SEBI registered Stock broker. निवेशक क्या करें और क्या न करें: 1. केवल रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के साथ ही व्यवहार/अनुबंध करें - जिस ब्रोकर के साथ आप लेन-देन कर रहे हों, उसके रेजिस्ट्रेशन सर्टिफिकेट की जाँच कर लें। यह नियामक कार्रवाई के लिए सहारा देता है। 2. फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन प्लान्स से सावधान रहें। ब्रोकर या उनके औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या उनका कोई भी प्रतिनिधि/कर्मचारी आपके निवेश पर फिक्सड/गारंटीकृत/नियमित रिटर्न/कैपिटल प्रोटेक्शन देने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है या आपके द्वारा दिये गए पैसो पर ब्याज का भुगतान करने के लिए आपके साथ कोई लोन समझौता करने के लिए औथोरइज्ड नहीं है। कृपया ध्यान दें कि किसी भी व्यवस्था / सांकेतिक रिटर्न के समझौते के तहत ब्रोकर को दिए गए फंड या सेक्युरिटीज़ के दावे आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा चूक होने पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा स्वीकार नहीं किया जाएगा । 3. कृपया आपने \\'केवाईसी\\' (KYC) पेपर में सभी जरूरी जानकारी खुद भरें और ब्रोकर से अपने \\'केवाईसी\\' पेपर की नियम अनुसार साइन की हुई प्रति प्राप्त करें। उन सभी शर्तों की जांच करें जिन्हें आपने सहमति और स्वीकृति दी है। 4. सुनिश्चित करें कि आपके स्टॉक ब्रोकर के पास हमेशा आपका नया और सही कांटैक्ट डिटेल हो जैसे ईमेल आईडी/मोबाइल नंबर। ईमेल और मोबाइल नंबर जरूरी है और एक्सचेंज रिकॉर्ड में अपडेट के लिए आपको अपने ब्रोकर को मोबाइल नंबर देना होगा। यदि आपको एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी से नियमित रूप से संदेश नहीं मिल रहे हैं, तो आपको स्टॉक ब्रोकर/एक्सचेंज के पास इस मामले को उठाना चाहिए। 5. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक (ई-मेल) कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट्स/फाइनेंशियल डिटेल्स का चयन सिर्फ तभी करें जब आप खुद कंप्यूटर के जानकार हों और आपका अपना ई-मेल अकाउंट हो और आप उसे प्रतिदिन/नियमित देखते हो। 6. आपके द्वारा किए गए ट्रेड के लिए एक्सचेंज से प्राप्त हुए किसी भी ईमेल/एसएमएस को अनदेखा न करें। अपने ब्रोकर से मिले कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट/अकाउंट के डिटेल से इसे वेरिफ़ाई करें। यदि कोई गड़बड़ी हो, तो अपने ब्रोकर को तुरंत इसके बारे में लिखित रूप से सूचित करें और यदि स्टॉक ब्रोकर जवाब नहीं देता है, तो एक्सचेंज/डिपॉजिटरी को तुरंत रिपोर्ट करें। 7. आपके द्वारा निश्चित की गई अकाउंट के सेटलमेंट कि फ्रिक्वेन्सी की जांच करें। यदि आपने रनिंग अकाउंट का ऑप्शन चुना है, तो कृपया कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपका ब्रोकर आपके अकाउंट का नियमित रूप से सेटलमेंट करता है और किसी भी स्थिति में 90 दिनों में एक बार ( यदि आपने 30 दिनों के सेटलमेंट का विकल्प चुना है तो 30 दिन) डिटेल्स भेजता है । कृपया ध्यान दें कि आपके ब्रोकर द्वारा डिफॉल्ट होने की स्थिति में एक्सचेंज द्वारा 90 दिनों से अधिक की अवधि के दावे एक्सैप्ट नहीं किए जाएंगे। 8. डिपॉजिटरी से प्राप्त अकाउंट की जानकारी (कंसोलिडेटेड अकाउंट स्टेटमेंट - सी ये एस) नियमित रूप से वेरिफ़ाई करते रहें और अपने ट्रेड/लेनदेन के साथ सामंजस्य स्थापित करें। 9. कन्फ़र्म करें कि पे-आउट की तारीख से 1 वर्किंग डे के भीतर आपके खाते में धनराशि/सिक्योरिटी (शेयर) का पेमेंट हो गया हो। कन्फ़र्म करें कि आपको अपने ट्रेड के 24 घंटों के भीतर कॉन्ट्रैक्ट नोट मिलते हों। 10. एनएसई की वेबसाइट पर ट्रेड वेरिफिकेशन की सुविधा भी उपलब्ध है जिसका उपयोग आप अपने ट्रेड के वेरिफिकेशन के लिए कर सकते हैं। 11. ब्रोकर के पास अनावश्यक बैलेंस न रखें। कृपया ध्यान रहे कि ब्रोकर के दिवालिया निष्कासित होने पर उन खातों के दावे स्वीकार नहीं होंगे जिनमें 90 दिन से कोई ट्रेड ना हुआ हो। 12. ब्रोकर्स को सिक्यूरिटि के ट्रांसफर को मार्जिन के रूप में स्वीकार करने की अनुमति नहीं है। मार्जिन के रूप में दी जाने वाली सिक्योरिटी ग्राहक के अकाउंट में ही रहनी चाहिए और यह ब्रोकर को गिरवी रखी जा सकती हैं। ग्राहकों को किसी भी कारण से ब्रोकर या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी या ब्रोकर के औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति के साथ कोई सिक्यूरिटी रखने की अनुमति नहीं है। ब्रोकर केवल कस्टमर द्वारा बेची गई सिक्योरिटी के डिपोजिट करने के लिए ग्राहकों से संबंधित सिक्योरिटी ले सकता है। 13. भारी मुनाफे का वादा करने वाले शेयर/सिक्योरिटी में व्यापार करने का लालच देकर ईमेल और एसएमएस भेजने वाले धोखेबाजों के झांसे में न आएं। 14. पीओए (पावर ऑफ अटॉर्नी) देते समय सावधान रहें - सभी अधिकार जिनका स्टॉक ब्रोकर प्रयोग कर सकते हैं और समय सीमा जिसके लिए पीओए मान्य है, इसे स्पष्ट रूप से बताएँ। यह ध्यान रहे कि सेबी/एक्सचेंजों के अनुसार पीओए अनिवार्य / आवश्यक नहीं है। 15. ब्रोकर द्वारा रिपोर्ट किए गए फंड और सिक्योरिटी बैलेंस के बारे में साप्ताहिक आधार पर एक्सचेंज द्वारा भेजे गए मैसेजों की जांच करें और यदि आप इसमें कोई अंतर पाते हैं, तो तुरंत एक्सचेंज को शिकायत करें। 16. किसी के साथ पासवर्ड (इंटरनेट अकाउंट) शेयर न करें। ऐसा करना अपने सुरक्षित पैसे शेयर करने जैसा है। 17. कृपया सेबी के रेजिस्टर्ड स्टॉक ब्रोकर के अलावा किसी औथोरइज्ड व्यक्ति या ब्रोकर के सहयोगी सहित किसी को भी ट्रेडिंग के उद्देश्य से फंड ट्रांसफर न करें। This is a system generated email, do not reply to this email id.

In case of an eSign option is made available, client should be given an option to choose the specific purpose(s) of DDPI\"\". Do\\'s & Dont\\'s 1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15.

Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15.

Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14.

What is Load Balancing? Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic among multiple servers to improve a service or application\\'s performance and reliability with your existing infrastructure resources. This reduces the strain on each server and makes the servers more efficient, speeding up performance and reducing latency. Why Load Balancing? Imagine a checkout line at a grocery store with 8 checkout lines, only one of which is open. All customers must get into the same line, and therefore it takes a long time for a customer to finish paying for their groceries. Now imagine that the store instead opens all 8 checkout lines. In this case, the wait time for customers is about 8 times shorter. Load balancing essentially accomplishes the same thing. By dividing user requests among multiple servers, user wait time is vastly cut down. This results in a better user experience — the grocery store customers in the example above would probably look for a more efficient grocery store if they always experienced long wait times. \"\"The combination of Load Balancing’s geolocation steering and Cloudflare’s caching makes sure customers are getting the fastest load times possible.\"\" Nigel Hepworth Managing Director at Active Solutions Try Load Balancing To Maximize Performance and Availability Get Started Upgrade Plan Login Visit Community Copyright © 2022 Cloudflare, Inc. 101 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94107 Unsubscribe\"\\n', '\"͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ ͏ Canva ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t0/4ShTzdt3RAqtx8UAuJ9_XvKXfg8-28MCg0YQG1ltZZ8 ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t1/0KfRevFNeI6iTq5icZEkcRYQag4hA58UBa5yhTbub6g ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlX6ZZCWxVAWc-i9ih8udhva-AHjetmm7JcNFHOznFQkSh9bKD8w8Xhy24AUZZvzjHw/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t2/zG9JK4YwYBjeFWhrgCpm22JvIeELGtakPhR1H3zVTlM ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlX6ZZCWxVAWc-i9ih8udhva-AHjetmm7JcNFHOznFQkSh9bKD8w8Xhy24AUZZvzjHw/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t3/wftnZzSnQI4CplDnZw7Ow3PbL5COLk_Q2UHahIJaNxI ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlY_JpxeYOSVyXaVGGgqc8MqIs5sZTzob_b9EvZR1tXQSlM4WKtInC8q8yLwqYJ8hNxnc30sInI8sjoOxoF3oTJ3ZP4ZDnjqdKoCDmQqaqPdGzrJpXZUh059FRE9gFKKbr8AvOKOAPWuJHz_k1tkWpYJF6psM5qWx_CTZxJTppexNNGodS69ew8cJUW1DlYoKmwrs0q8Wza2zkRbYK0XkUkrV-4HcqAoAp-zb_W5ABeKQJU2lnPkgfF729ZTk8vwEIN2vPT1smQsl0vnlf-emMSc/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t4/dFvYA0cE_yVkkw3WxnDfESZqdHCg2yArChRq3eThhrE ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlY_JpxeYOSVyXaVGGgqc8MqIs5sZTzob_b9EvZR1tXQSlM4WKtInC8q8yLwqYJ8hNxnc30sInI8sjoOxoF3oTJ3ZP4ZDnjqdKoCDmQqaqPdGzrJpXZUh059FRE9gFKKbr8AvOKOAPWuJHz_k1tkWpYJF6psM5qWx_CTZxJTppexNNGodS69ew8cJUW1DlYoKmwrs0q8Wza2zkRbYK0XkUkrV-4HcqAoAp-zb_W5ABeKQJU2lnPkgfF729ZTk8vwEIN2vPT1smQsl0vnlf-emMSc/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t5/yWakZ02g_ia0vACmOA6YhuraG5FRmbELSwwZiARS8vw ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlY_JpxeYOSVyXaVGGgqc8MqIs5sZTzob_b9EvZR1tXQSlM4WKtInC8q8yLwqYJ8hNxnc30sInI8sjoOxoF3oTJ3ZP4ZDnjqdKoCDmQqaqPdGzrJpXZUh059FRE9gFKKbr8AvOKOAPWuJHz_k1tkWpYJF6psM5qWx_CTZxJTppexNNGodS69ew8cJUW1DlYoKmwrs0q8Wza2zkRbYK0XkUkrV-4HcqAoAp-zb_W5ABeKQJU2lnPkgfF729ZTk8vwEIN2vPT1smQsl0vnlf-emMSc/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t6/k4U5Tzkf0tluAuSPtLKSl76FQnoCSOTnNylkbrQFD-Y ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumlY_JpxeYOSVyXaVGGgqc8MqIs5sZTzob_b9EvZR1tXQSlM4WKtInC8q8yLwqYJ8hNxnc30sInI8sjoOxoF3oTJ3ZP4ZDnjqdKoCDmQqaqPdGzrJpXZUh059FRE9gFKKbr8AvOKOAPWuJHz_k1tkWpYJF6psM5qWx_CTZxJTppexNNGodS69ew8cJUW1DlYoKmwrs0q8Wza2zkRbYK0XkUkrV-4HcqAoAp-zb_W5ABeKQJU2lnPkgfF729ZTk8vwEIN2vPT1smQsl0vnlf-emMSc/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t7/NQKYx5Egtmkx4DaddPXiyXzIc82okhOILWmZmwLMYNw ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t8/8zmI1eLjAgxB0pL_22CrvDY-DXZU-W5NV1xdEp6eSlY ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t9/sP93FWWgv2q0cJWa0QCAzgGbeVg5DzyNHvUr_sC7RIw ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t10/c2tAgSEaitW_B3AQf5hDTQMsDmMaWPt412AbQ5xUHBE ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t11/OhjtatFXinVI7JFrXir73-3yTfM1Gq9ezdrxK4KVWEs ) ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t12/ZPIRBI0_sB0-5nwDFuDB9RniVdlYht8h-i7pR3ZCiyQ ) app store ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t13/EG8pR5_sHRB0WpOQ3bVed813inny0kpuSJqNkoBxKgI ) google play ( https://l.engage.canva.com/ss/c/N56jrjxtajclrFz56qumldhWXdjEiY6blaOIqf4-eX4/40b/odqreuxzR6uzf5CtE4-KZw/t14/tUdauz91Ej44Vkco2rGovDqEmR5KaiuHOBsFVZ20684 ) Canva Pty Ltd, 110 Kippax St, NSW 2010, Australia.

The DDPI shall serve the same purpose of POA and significantly mitigate the misuse of POA. You should be aware that the stockbroker and depository participant cannot directly / indirectly compel the clients to execute the DDPI or deny services to the client if the client refuses to execute the DDPI. Please refer to SEBI Circular dated October 06, 2022, for the list of instructions which client can give to its stockbroker / depository participant. You may refer the following link for same: https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/oct-2022/execution-of-demat-debit-and-pledge-instruction-ddpi-for-transfer-of-securities-towards-deliveries-settlement-obligations-and-pledging-re-pledging-of-securities-clarification_63724.html ( https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/oct-2022/execution-of-demat-debit-and-pledge-instruction-ddpi-for-transfer-of-securities-towards-deliveries-settlement-obligations-and-pledging-re-pledging-of-securities-clarification_63724.html ) Should you wish to give any instructions, these need to be signed in physical against each purpose of DDPI. In case of an eSign option is made available, client should be given an option to choose the specific purpose(s) of DDPI\"\". Do\\'s & Dont\\'s 1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary you are dealing with. It allows recourse to regulatory action. 2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection schemes. Brokers or their authorized persons or any of their associates are not authorized to offer fixed/guaranteed/regular returns/ capital protection on your investment or authorized to enter into any loan agreement with you to pay interest on the funds offered by you. Please note that claims for funds or securities given to the broker under any arrangement/ agreement of indicative return will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 3. Please ensure that you fill all the required details in ‘KYC’ document by yourself and receive duly signed copy of your ‘KYC’ documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you. 4. Always keep your contact details viz. Mobile number/Email ID updated with the stock broker. Email and mobile number is mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. 5. Opt for electronic (e-mail) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have your own e-mail account. 6. Don\\'t ignore any emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you. Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately and if the Stock Broker does not respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories forthwith. 7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for. If you have opted for running account, please ensure that your broker settles your account and sends statement of accounts regularly and in any case not later than once in 90 days (or 30 days if you have opted for 30 days settlement). Please note that claims for a period longer than 90 days will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 8. Regularly verify Consolidated Accounts Statement (CAS) received from Depositories and reconcile with your trades / transactions. 9. Ensure that pay-out of funds/securities is received in your account within 1 working day from the date of pay-out. Ensure that you receive Contract Notes within 24 hours of your trades. 10. Trade verification facility is also available on NSE website which you can use to verify your trades executed. 11. Do not keep funds idle with the Stock Broker. Please note that claims for funds, without transactions on the exchange will not be accepted by the Exchange in case of default by your broker. 12. Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as margin. Securities offered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the account of the client and can be pledged to the broker. Clients are not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason. Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for settlement of securities sold by the client. 13. Do not fall prey to fraudsters sending emails and SMSs luring to trade in stocks/ Securities promising huge profits. 14. Be careful while executing the PoA (Power of Attorney) - specify all the rights that the stock broker can exercise and timeframe for which PoA is valid. It may be noted that PoA is not a mandatory requirement as per SEBI / Exchanges. 15.
